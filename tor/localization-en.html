    <div name="personality" fullname="Personality">
        A hero’s personality comes through in his capacity to
        impress, encourage and influence others. A good level
        of proficiency in all three skills in this group is the mark
        of a leader.
    </div>
    <div name="movement" fullname="Movement">
        Overcoming obstacles, enduring long journeys and
        moving secretly are the stuff adventurers are made of.
    </div>
    <div name="perception" fullname="Perception">
        The ability to catch hidden details often pays off, be it
        noticing an odd noise that gives away an ambusher,
        catching the gleam in the eyes of a liar or spotting the
        crack in the wall that reveals a secret door.
    </div>
    <div name="survival" fullname="Survival">
        The three skills of this group, essential for a roving
        adventurer, make a hero an invaluable member of a
        company.
    </div>
    <div name="custom" fullname="Custom">
        While heroes are often held to be uncivilised brutes
        by the common folk, their lives can sometimes depend
        on knowing the proper words, wisest song or cleverest
        answer. Excelling in these skills is considered a noble
        achievement.
    </div>
    <div name="vocation" fullname="Vocation">
        Before his resolve hardened and pushed a hero on his
        road to adventure, he probably led a life much like an
        ordinary individual of his folk; learning a trade, defending
        his people and absorbing their accumulated wisdom
    </div>
    <div name="awe" fullname="Awe">
        This skill measures a hero’s capacity to provoke respect in
        onlookers, and determines the impression a hero makes
        on someone he meets for the first time. Depending on the
        circumstances and the hero’s intentions or disposition,
        it can be used to instil wonderment, admiration, or even
        fear.  Awe arises from a character’s native charisma,
        but can also be engineered with a dramatic entrance or
        impressive attire.	<br />
        A successful use of the skill provokes the chosen effect. A
        failure fails to have any impact, or can even lead to the
        opposite result! Achieving a great success means that
        the hero has won the hearts of the onlookers, or cowed
        them into silent submission. An extraordinary success
        may produce open reverence, or panic.
    </div>
    <div name="inspire" fullname="Inspire">
        A hero able to Inspire others can instil positive feelings
        in others, urging them to act on the matter at hand. This
        is a feat achieved mainly through example, charisma and
        personal conviction, rather than through the effective
        use of words (which falls under  Persuade, below). It
        can be used on individuals, but is especially effective in
        influencing crowds. Heroes with high  Inspire ratings
        can be forceful orators, passionate agitators, and well-
        loved leaders of men.<br />
        A successful Inspire roll awakens a chosen feeling in the
        subject, so long as it is not in opposition to their current
        mood. A great success is enough to influence wholly
        disinterested individuals, and an extraordinary success
        may turn rivals into supporters.
    </div>
    <div name="persuade" fullname="Persuade">
        This skill allows a hero to apply his or her reasoning to
        convince another individual of an idea or course of action.
        It can be used to influence small groups of listeners, but
        only if used in an appropriate context, such as a common
        hall. An attempt at persuasion requires more time than
        other  Personality skills, but can have a more lasting
        impact on other characters’ actions. A high  Persuade
        score denotes an uncommon eloquence, a love of speech
        and knowledge of its proper use and its effect on listeners.
        Wise men, advisors to chieftains and kings and their
        messengers all share this passion for the spoken word.
        <br />
        The successful use of the skill lets the hero convince his
        audience of the flaws in their current position. A great
        success convinces the subject of the quality of the hero’s
        stance, while an extraordinary success may turn the
        subject into an ardent believer.
    </div>
    <div name="athletics" fullname="Athletics">
        Athletics is a broad skill, covering most of the physical
        activities that a hero might undertake while adventuring,
        including running, leaping, climbing, swimming and
        throwing stones or other small objects. Heroes with high
        Athletics skill scores exhibit a winning combination
        of physical prowess, grace and control, generally
        gained through continuous exercise and daily exertion. <br />
        A successful  Athletics roll produces a satisfactory
        outcome in the physical activity, while a failed roll
        might even lead to serious harm, depending on the
        circumstances. A great or extraordinary result suggests
        a spectacular achievement.
    </div>
    <div name="travel" fullname="Travel">
        In the Third Age, the cities, villages and towns of Middle-
        earth are often separated by many leagues of wild or
        deserted areas. Roads that used to lead safely to distant
        realms now end in broken trails that go nowhere.
        When the company  needs to cover a distance across
        uncertain territory,
        including by boat,
        every companion is
        required to perform
        one or more tests
        using the Travel skill
        to avoid becoming
        weary too soon. While
        certainly the product
        of experience, the
        use of Travel benefits
        mostly from a hero’s
        strength of spirit.
    </div>
    <div name="stealth" fullname="Stealth">
        A hero resorts to Stealth whenever he needs, or is forced,
        to act in a furtive or secret way. The skill includes hiding,
        moving quietly and shadowing others. These activities
        often rely on quickness and precision, so a stealthy hero
        combines practiced caution with the ability to judge the
        right moment to take a chance. Hunters, burglars, and
        solitary fighters use Stealth to prosper in their trade. <br />
        A successful  Stealth roll indicates that the character
        has gone unnoticed, while a failure has almost certainly
        attracts unwanted attention. <br />
        A great or extraordinary success produces an outcome
        so flawless that it even be impossible to trace the hero’s
        actions after the fact.
    </div>
    <div name="awareness" fullname="Awareness">
        The Awareness skill represents a hero’s readiness to react
        and his ability to notice something unexpected, out of
        the ordinary, or
        difficult to detect.
        High skill reflects
        both keen senses
        and the experience
        to understand what
        you see and hear. <br />
        A high Awareness
        rating expresses
        an extraordinary
        watchfulness, and
        is extremely useful
        to a companion
        who serves as a
        look-out for the
        company.
    </div>
    <div name="insight" fullname="Insight">
        Insight is the ability of a hero to see beyond appearances,
        recognising people’s hidden thoughts and beliefs. Heroes
        with Insight can recognise when someone is lying, and
        can draw useful conclusions about people’s motives. A
        hero with a high  Insight score is often recognised as
        being a sensible and discerning individual, and many
        might seek his counsel.<br />
        A successful  Insight roll provides the hero with a
        faithful, if partial, portrait of the character observed.
        A great or extraordinary success reveals truths about
        an individual of which he himself is ignorant.  Insight
        tests may be rolled in opposition to an adversary using
        Persuade or another Personality skill.
    </div>
    <div name="search" fullname="Search">
        Search is used when trying to find something by close
        examination. This skill may let a hero search a library to
        locate a piece of relevant information, look for concealed
        doors or hidden inscriptions, recognise a familiar face in
        a crowd or even search a suspected thief’s clothing. One
        roll is required for each inspection of a small area, such
        as a room.  Search rolls are generally initiated by the
        player rather than the Loremaster; Awareness is used
        to see if the characters passively notice something.<br />
        A successful Search roll generally lets the characters find
        what they are looking for if it is to be found. A great or
        extraordinary success usually means the object is found
        more quickly. If an item is particularly well hidden, the
        Loremaster could decide that a higher level of success is
        required to uncover it.
    </div>
    <div name="explore" fullname="Explore">
        Adventurers rely on their Explore skill when they move
        through an unfamiliar area of the Wild. An Explore test
        may be required during a journey to find the company’s
        heading, or to get back on track after a detour; to
        cope with adverse weather conditions or other natural
        hazards; to create paths through the wilderness suitable
        for others to follow; or to choose a suitable place to
        set up camp. A high  Explore rating is an invaluable
        resource for a companion acting as a scout for his group
        of adventurers.
    </div>
    <div name="healing" fullname="Healing">
        The knowledge of how to relieve pain and apply remedies
        to restore health to the suffering is an ancient one, and
        treatments differ from culture to culture. Almost all
        traditions, however, agree on the treatment of serious
        injuries, which must be immediately tended to keep
        from worsening.<br />
        The  Healing skill
        includes bone setting
        and the use of herbs
        or salves, but the
        outcome relies on
        the ability of the
        healer to understand
        what ails the sufferer
        and determine what
        should be done.
    </div>
    <div name="hunting" fullname="Hunting">
        Knowing how to hunt is a fundamental skill common in
        much of Middle-earth. A Hunting roll may be required
        when pursuing a creature through wild areas, or to
        locate tracks and follow them, or to identify a quarry by
        its spoor. <br />
        The skill also covers preparing traps and the training and
        use of hunting dogs or birds. In wilder areas, hunters
        learn to apply their trade to more dangerous quarry,
        such as Orcs, Spiders or Wargs, or else risk becoming
        the prey.
    </div>
    <div name="song" fullname="Song">
        Hobbits and Men, Elves and Dwarves, even Goblins and
        maybe Orcs: all the creatures of Middle-earth celebrate
        by playing music and singing songs. Great deeds and
        grim misfortunes are remembered in verse, and pleasant
        or even comic stories are told to ease spirits and find
        comfort. <br />
        Song is used to recite poems, sing songs or play
        instruments suitable to the character’s culture. It can
        also be used to learn new works or create original
        compositions.
    </div>
    <div name="courtesy" fullname="Courtesy">
        The Free Peoples recognise common norms of decency
        and ancient conventions of behaviour. Observing these
        traditions demonstrates respect and is a way of quickly
        establishing a friendly footing even with complete
        strangers. <br />
        A hero succeeding in a Courtesy roll knows what to say
        at the right moment to make a good impression with
        their host, or is mindful of his manners when receiving
        guests.
    </div>
    <div name="riddle" fullname="Riddle">
        Owing its name to the ancient Game, the Riddle skill
        represents a hero’s ability to draw conclusions from
        seemingly unconnected scraps of information, by
        deduction, reasoning and intuition. <br />
        An adventurer also relies on  Riddle whenever he is
        forced to talk about a subject but wants to conceal part
        of what he knows, for example to explain something
        about himself without revealing his true identity. <br />
        An accepted custom among many creatures, speaking
        in riddles is usually allowed among strangers meeting
        for the first time who want to speak guardedly. This skill
        is also used to gain helpful insight from a spoken or
        written riddle.
    </div>
    <div name="craft" fullname="Craft">
        The Craft skill doesn’t really cover the whole range of
        abilities of smiths, wrights and other artisans, but reflects
        the talent of a character for making or mending things
        by hand, although Traits like Smithcraft or Woodwright
        can be used to reflect proficiency in a specific craft.
        Craft could be used to attempt to repair the wheel of
        a cart, or construct
        an improvised raft
        with wood found on
        a river shore, or even
        when trying to start a
        fire on a windy hill. <br />
        A high  Craft score
        may indicate that the
        hero was a craftsman
        before starting his life
        of adventure. Some
        races, such as the
        Dwarves and Noldor
        Elves, revere crafts as
        the highest expression
        of creativity.
    </div>
    <div name="battle" fullname="Battle">
        A hero’s proficiency in this skill shows his grasp of the
        rules of battle, and his ability to keep his head when
        involved in a violent confrontation. The Battle skill can
        be used to gain an advantage when involved in a fight
        with a group of foes, or to lead a company of men in
        open battle and maintain order in the midst of chaos
        (combat itself is covered by Weapon skills).
    </div>
    <div name="lore" fullname="Lore">
        Lore expresses a hero’s love for learning, be it a
        fascination with descriptions of distant lands, or an
        interest in family genealogy. Whenever an action involves
        knowledge of some kind, a Lore roll is required. <br />
        Heroes are considered to be knowledgeable in the
        traditions of their own people, and so the Loremaster
        should rarely require a player to make a  Lore test
        for information regarding their character’s culture,
        background or the area they originally come from.
    </div>
    <div name="body" fullname="Body">
        A character with a high Body score can be tough and fit,
        or tall and agile, or even attractive or imposing. Every
        aspect of a character that relies on vigour or physical
        well-being is represented in the game by Body.
    </div>
    <div name="heart" fullname="Heart">
        Measures a character’s capacity for emotion, energy
        and enthusiasm. A hero with a high Heart score can be
        fiery, intense, and hard to demoralise. Activities that
        benefit from a passionate or energetic temper may be
        influenced by a character’s Heart score.
    </div>
    <div name="wits" fullname="Wits">
        A hero with a high Wits rating can be clever, attentive and
        strong-willed. A sharp-witted person is a quick thinker,
        and probably alert and vigilant, so any action that calls
        upon these qualities benefits from a hero’s Wits score.
    </div>
    <div name="barding" fullname="Barding of Dale">
        The Men of Dale are Northmen of noble origins. They
        are often tall and strong-limbed, with fair hair, although
        dark or even black hair is not unknown. Their men
        usually shave their beards completely unless they are
        very old, and cut their hair shorter than the Woodmen
        of Wilderland. Women let their hair grow very long, but
        often braid it in tight tresses. Adventurers from Dale can
        be easily recognised as they carry the best equipment to
        be found among the Men living in Wilderland.
    </div>
    <div name="stoutHearted" fullname="Stout-hearted">
        Living for many a year under the ever-present menace

        halfling who crossed words with Smaug the Golden in

        strength as a youth. Under the shadow of the Dragon,
        your family’s business struggled for survival and you
        dared not venture far, but since the death of Smaug,
        you and your brothers have started to journey to the
        Elvenking’s forest stronghold. After many visits to those

        Beornings are rugged men with brawny arms and legs,

        grandfather died he was more than one hundred years
        old. He was a hardy warrior, but you remember him best
        wrapped in his white wolf-skin, recounting tales about
        the bygone days of his youth. He could use words as
        precious as fine diamonds or as loud as clashing iron as
        he spoke of battles won and lost, of kings forgotten and
        buried, and of a threatening Shadow so old its age could
        not be counted in men’s lives. You treasure his tales as
        an invaluable inheritance.

        The elders and ancient warriors of your tribe spend the
        long evening hours talking in front of the hearth, on the
        stepped dais of the main hall. To the young and restless,
        their soft speaking may seem idle talk, but you loved to
        listen to their wise words as they exchanged tales and
        songs, as old as the intricate images wound around the
        wooden pillars of the hall. One day you might well end
        up adding your own words to the songs of your folk,
        strengthening the bonds of tradition.

        Dwarves are an ancient and secretive race, whose
        customs and traditions are mostly unknown to outsiders.
        At the end of the Third Age, they are a proud but
        dwindling people, survivors from a distant past. Almost
        all Dwarves that can be encountered speak of themselves
        as belonging to ‘Durin’s folk’. They are probably the most
        redoubtable warriors in Middle-earth, hard to break or
        corrupt, but often at odds with other Free Peoples over
        old quarrels or new slights.

        to delve deeper once again for far more precious ore.
        Unfortunately, to this day most ancient Dwarf-holds are
        no more than Dragon’s lairs or Orc-infested pits. You toil
        patiently, peering into the gloom with eyes hungry for the
        gleaming of gems and gold.

        By the reckoning of the Dwarves, you were only a stripling
        when you left your home in the Blue Mountains to follow
        your kinsmen along the trading roads. You have since seen
        many places and met different folks eager to trade goods
        for the product of dwarven handiwork. You remember
        little of the roads you took, as you were led by your more
        experienced kin, but those journeys have awoken in you

        his enforced exile. His malady proved infectious, and
        over the long years, your longing for the lost home of
        your forefathers consumed you day after day. You tried
        to quench your spite in forgetfulness, but the embers of
        your anger never died completely.

        The hardships endured by your folk during two ages of
        the world have inspired many songs. But the words that
        come easier to your lips are those recounting deeds of
        courage and valour or, even better, those exalting the
        craft of your forefathers in works of cunning and skill.

        Your grandfather never relented in his hunt for the Orc-

        you along dim underground passages, he told you much
        about the cruel ways of the servants of the Shadow, and
        how to fight them. His words scared you when you were
        young and haunted your dreams, but now that you have

        value of his advice.

        Your elder brother instructed you to judge others by their
        deeds, not their words, especially when dealing with the

        your instinct above all else, as your heart is not easily
        swayed. Thieves and liars do not dare to meet your eyes,

        Elusive warriors devoted to the preservation of their

        but have not robbed them of the ability to delight in the
        simple pleasures of living. Even though their power is
        slowly waning, Elves are staunch fighters dedicated to
        resisting the encroaching darkness, either alone or side-
        by-side with trusted allies. As all those who belong to
        the Firstborn, they are not subject to illness or old age,

        leave your forest home, but now you have no regrets.
        The world beyond the King’s realm is wide and, while
        full of hidden threats, is also populated by other valiant
        peoples, enemies of the same Shadow that your kin has

    <div name="elfBackground3" fullname="Memory of Suffering">
        A long time ago, Elves akin to your folk dwelt around
        the Naked Hill in the south of Greenwood the Great,
        before the Necromancer claimed it to build his fastness
        of sorcery. Now that the Shadow has fled, you have
        often journeyed there to spy upon that dreaded place,
        to ponder on the hurt suffered by your people in many
        years of cruel warfare. Many of your kinsmen prefer to

        your noble countenance, and much is expected of you in

        for centuries. The wood sings to you as tree branches
        sway and leaves rustle; enchanting music you strive to
        decipher. Some find your ways to be simple and rustic,

        Hobbits are much smaller than Men, even smaller than
        Dwarves, and are often mistaken for children by Men
        who see them. Such likeness may be explained through
        a long-forgotten common ancestry, which would also
        explain why Hobbits often like or dislike the same things
        as Men do. A merry folk, Hobbits are good-natured
        individuals. When pushed to resort to weapons, they
        choose small swords and short hunting bows, which
        they can shoot with uncanny precision when needs be.

        Hobbits possess a cheerful spirit and a friendliness that

        learned their place in the world a long time ago, and
        a deep-rooted sense of proportion has found its place
        in their hearts. No visions or wild fantasies can  tempt
        them, as they do not seek power or control over others. <br />

        from farmhands and traders. From time to time, you

        Your father was a tradesman and you were supposed
        to take his place in his workshop in Hardbottle at the

        took you and you were away from home for months.
        When you came back, you renounced your position, to
        the outrage of your whole neighbourhood. But you know

        Your uncle was a Sheriff, and often brought you along
        with him when he went ‘beating the bounds’, that is,
        when he was appointed to watch the Shire’s borders for
        Outsiders. More often than not, his watch included a

        once vanished, only to show up three days later at the

        the North Moors. Some believe your family’s fortune is

        on your way home one night, when you spotted some
        outlandish folk around a bright camp-fire. When you
        described them to your grandmother, she told you they
        were Dwarves, on their way to the Blue Mountains. From
        that night you started to shun well-trodden paths, hoping
        to meet other wayfarers secretly crossing the Shire.

        surly of speech and unforthcoming by other folk, they
        are rangers and hunters, haters of Orcs and Spiders,
        skilled in fighting in the deep of the woods with bows of
        yew, stout spears, and long-hafted axes. They were once
        skilful tamers of steeds and hunting dogs, but their life

        their natural grace and ferocious loyalty. But, above all,
        you share their love for the hunt, and you can feel their

        Many years ago, you and your sisters and brothers used
        to challenge each other to recall the stories depicted in
        the woven tapestries hung along the walls of the great

        of the wizard Radagast, and he told you how the deeds
        of your ancestors were handed down from generation
        to generation as songs. He taught you that there are

        as winter nights, spent underground searching for the

        the eaves of the forest. Your father’s rules prevented you
        from straying from the paths connecting Woodland Hall
        to the southern homesteads, but at times you have seen

        Rhymes of Lore are brief compositions in verse created
        by many cultures to remember significant facts from
        ancient history. Your knowledge of them can supplement
        a test of Lore, but is used especially in conjunction with
        any Custom skill (Courtesy, Song or Riddle). Scholars

        unifying most of what is malicious, dark and terrible

        have little patience in dealing with others, and prefer to

        Raise your standard of living from Prosperous to Rich;

        If, during play, you receive a wound that would normally
        kill you (a coup de grâce or a killing blow) you can choose
        between the following options: <br />
        1. You die, and let your direct descendant inherit the
        Birthright Virtue as an additional Cultural blessing
        (a free Virtue at character creation), or <br />
        2. You are saved by some miraculous circumstance
        that leaves you wounded but alive. You then reset your
        Standing rating to zero, as you are then presumed
        dead by your own folk. You can do this only once,
        and never again.

        Many citizens of ancient Dale found themselves blessed
        – or cursed – by a sort of foresight following Smaug’s
        destruction of the city. As a descendent of one of these
        bloodlines, you share this gift.<br />
        Sometimes, you feel a sense of foreboding that warns
        you of impending catastrophe and other gloomy events.
        But the future is always uncertain, and sometimes what
        you foresee never materialises.<br />
        Raise your maximum Hope score by 1 point. Additionally,
        once every Adventuring phase, you may invoke your
        power of foresight. When this happens, the Loremaster
        should give you a relevant piece of information
        regarding negative events likely to occur during your
        current adventure. If no such information is available
        – or the Loremaster prefers not to divulge it – at the
        start of the next Fellowship phase, he must award you
        one Experience point instead (your foresight contained
        a more intimate message, leading to a sudden bout of
        insight or deeper understanding).
        <br />
        Your foresight manifests in many forms: it can be a hazy

        Additionally, from now on your sight and hearing are
        greatly enhanced at night, and let you see or hear better
        than under the light of the sun, and at a greater distance:
        when you make a roll using a Perception skill at night

        In this state, you can spend a point of Hope to explore an

        Your spirit form takes the appearance of a full-grown
        bear. It is visible to onlookers, and leaves tracks on the
        ground. While you are outside your body, any action
        you attempt is resolved using your Attributes and skills
        as usual, but any strenuous activity causing the loss
        of Endurance wakes you up. Any harm suffered while
        travelling in spirit form is transferred to your body at the

        wild. You have been shown the secret of baking such
        cakes, and can prepare them for the consumption of all

        Raise your company’s Fellowship rating by one point.
        Additionally, when you are on a journey, you and your

    <div name="brokenSpells" fullname="Broken Spells">
        You have been taught some long-remembered fragments
        of old spells that retain power to this day.  Some require
        you to cut or engrave a Runic inscription, usually in stone
        or metal, or sometimes carved in wood. You can learn a
        total of three spells: secrecy, prohibition and exclusion,
        and opening and shutting. <br />
        You must choose one spell when you first select this
        Virtue, and you may learn a new one by spending
        one Experience point as your undertaking during a
        Fellowship phase.
        <br />
        <b>Spells of Opening and Shutting</b><br />
        This fragment must be recited in front of a door or gate,
        to magically lock it, or recited backwards to open it if
        locked. The spell has no effect on a door that has been
        blocked by magic and now requires a particular word to
        open it, but might work if the entrance was barred by the
        same type of magic.<br />
        The spell starts working as soon as you have finished
        reciting it.<br />
        <b>Spells of Prohibition and Exclusion</b><br />
        This Runic inscription was usually placed on gates and
        on doors, to protect an area from unwanted visitors.
        You may carve these signs on a rock or on the bark of a
        tree within the perimeter of your camp, and their power
        will wake you at the first sign of danger. <br />
        Carve the runes and go to sleep. You will immediately
        awaken if any threatening presence approaches.
        <br />
        <b>Spells of Secrecy</b><br />
        Carve these runes on a concealed door, personal hiding
        place or object, and it will be noticed only if someone
        searches for it with great care. These signs are invisible
        to the untrained eye as long as the power within them is
        still working; they can only be seen and read when the
        spell is spent or broken.<br />
        The object concealed by the spell can only be found with
        an extraordinary Search result, unless the searcher is a
        Dwarf (in which case a simple success is enough).

        When you are fighting Orcs and their kind using hand-
        to-hand weapons, add a bonus of +3, or your Valour
        rating (whichever is higher), to the total Endurance loss
        inflicted by each of your blows.

    <div name="ravensOfTheMountain" fullname="Ravens of the Mountain">
        You have befriended a raven of the ancient breed living
        around the Lonely Mountain. Long-lived and able to
        speak the common tongue, these birds are often wise
        companions, bound to your kin by ties of old friendship.
        Many times in the past they have provided invaluable
        help by gathering news or sending messages for your
        folk.<br />
        If you are in Wilderland, your raven friend is never far
        away. You can sound a call and summon him to your
        presence in a matter of minutes. As soon as he joins you,
        you may command him.<br />
        Usually, the raven is eager to please you, but an
        unusual or less than reasonable request might put their
        faithfulness to the test and require a  Courtesy roll
        against a TN of 14. The raven does not ask for anything
        in return, but repeated requests over a short time might
        sooner or later lead him to feel entitled to compensation
        (his precise terms are up to the Loremaster, and might
        lead to interesting story developments). <br />
        The time needed for a raven to complete the errand
        depends on the request, on the distance to be covered,
        and on the complexity of the assignment. A raven flies
        at an average speed of thirty miles per hour (enough to
        cross the whole width of Mirkwood in one day)<br />
        The following list shows some of the possible errands
        you can assign to your winged ally, but should in no way
        limit your inventiveness. <br />
        <b>Bring tidings</b>: a raven is always well informed about
        the latest events concerning the Wild, and is eager to
        report them. <br />
        <b>Carry messages</b>: the raven can deliver messages
        anywhere in the region, passing its content to others of
        his kin. <br />
        <b>Investigate</b>: the raven can be sent to gather information
        on a specific subject. It must be something naturally
        accessible to one of its kind.<br />
        <b>Carry food</b>: a raven might be persuaded to carry some
        food if able to steal or borrow it from a location within
        a day’s flight.

    <div name="theStiffNeckOfDwarves" fullname="The Stiff Neck of Dwarves">
        Dwarves are deemed to be stubborn and unyielding.
        Their natural inclination to persevere against all odds is
        strengthened by the taint of the Shadow.<br />
        You add a number equal to your current Shadow score
        to all your rolls involving the use of a Common skill (with
        the exception of all Custom skills).
    </div>
    <div name="deadlyArchery" fullname="Deadly Archery">
        Most members of your kin possess a natural talent for
        hitting the mark when using their bows. You seem to
        possess that quality yourself, as your arrows find their
        target with uncanny precision.<br />
        When you spend a point of Hope to invoke an Attribute
        bonus on a ranged attack roll using a bow, you receive
        an additional bonus equal to your basic Heart score.
    </div>
    <div name="elvishDreams" fullname="Elvish Dreams">
        You have learnt to recover from your exertions while
        engaging in a repetitive task, like walking, or rowing in
        a boat. <br />
        At the end of a day of activity, you recover a number of
        Endurance points equal to your Wisdom rank. If you
        then take a prolonged rest, you recover normally.
    </div>
    <div name="shadowBane" fullname="Shadow Bane">
        Your folk have suffered grievous losses during many
        wars against the Shadow. Even the passing of centuries
        cannot quell the bitter hate that your kindred harbour
        for the Enemy. <br />
        When you are fighting in a Forward stance
        against servants of the Shadow (including Spiders, Orcs,
        Trolls and Evil Men), add one Success die to all your attack
        rolls (up to a maximum of 6).
    </div>
    <div name="theSpeakers" fullname="The Speakers">
        You have learnt how to communicate with almost
        everything, from any living being to grass, stone and
        water. This means, for example, that you can hear from
        the stones in a path who trod it recently, or sing to soothe
        an unquiet animal.<br />
        To use this gift you must make an appropriate skill roll.
        Which skill you use depends on what you are trying to
        do and is at the Loremaster’s discretion, but here are a
        few examples: to interpret the words of the stones in a
        path requires a roll of Riddle; to restrain a scared horse
        requires a roll of Song; to listen to the voice of a river
        requires a roll of Insight.
    </div>
    <div name="woodElfMagic" fullname="Wood-elf Magic">
        You are mastering what mortals might call ‘Elf-magic.’
        You learn how to fling a Stinging Arrow when you first
        select this Virtue. You may later master the making
        of  Elf-lights as your undertaking, and spending one
        Experience point during a Fellowship phase; finally,
        you discover the secret of Enchanted Sleep by spending
        another Experience point as another undertaking during
        a later Fellowship phase.<br />
        <b>Stinging Arrow</b><br />
        You can make an arrow flicker as if with a magical fire,
        making it fly true.<br />
        Spend a point of Hope when you let loose an arrow and
        it will fly up to twice its normal range, OR spend a point
        of Hope after a successful ranged attack using a bow or
        great bow to produce an automatic Piercing blow. <br />
        <b>Elf-lights</b><br />
        You know how to make a torch or a lamp burn with a
        peculiar flame that attracts all mortals who see it.
        Spend a point of Hope to light a torch, or a lamp. Any
        speaking creature who sees its flame must try to get near
        it by any means possible, or spend a point of Hope (or
        Hate) to ignore the spell effect. <br />
        You may snuff out the light at will, even from a distance,
        either to extinguish the flame quickly and quietly, or
        to cause it to flare suddenly to blind and confuse your
        enemies (those standing close to the flare are fight as if
        Weary for one round of combat).<br />
        <b>Enchanted Sleep</b><br />
        Having used an elf-light to attract an unwary victim, you
        can enchant him into slumber. <br />
        You may snuff out the elf-light when someone enters the
        area illuminated by the light. The first living creature
        with an Attribute level lower than 6 that enters the area
        drops immediately in an enchanted sleep.
    </div>
    <div name="artOfDisappearing" fullname="Art of Disappearing">
        You have learnt to choose exactly the right moment
        to turn away from the attention of others, sometimes
        unconsciously anticipating the need to disappear.<br />
        At the start of an episode where the location you are
        in is entered by newcomers, and if the location offers
        even the smallest opportunity to hide or sneak silently
        away, you can spend a point of Hope to disappear. You
        could slip into a convenient shadowy corner, a thick
        patch of undergrowth, a crowded room, a sharp bend
        in a passage underground or any other potentially
        concealing feature – the final decision on whether there
        is available concealment lies with the Loremaster. <br />
        No roll is needed, and you are considered to be present
        in the area, but unseen to the eyes of the interlopers.
        If the newly arrived individuals knew that you were
        present, it is as if you actually disappeared into thin
        air. You can at any moment choose to reveal yourself,
        simply stepping into the open from your hiding place.

    <div name="braveAtAPinch" fullname="Brave at a Pinch">
        One of the Wise once said that you have to put a Hobbit
        in a tight place before you find out what is in them (the
        problem being that they try their best to avoid tight
        places...).<br />
        When you spend a point of Hope to invoke an Attribute
        bonus, you additionally cancel all penalties enforced from
        being Weary for that action.

        You have spent a great deal of your time practising
        with all sorts of throwing games, and your accuracy is

        When you make a ranged attack, you can roll the Feat
        die twice and keep the best result.

    <div name="toughInTheFibre" fullname="Tough in the Fibre">
        When you are allowed to take a prolonged rest in a safe
        place (not ‘on the road’), you recover your health at a
        prodigious pace, whether you are hurt or simply tired.<br />
        If you are Wounded and your injury hasn’t been treated
        you recover 2 Endurance points; if you are Wounded and
        your injury has been treated successfully, you recover
        4 Endurance points; if you are uninjured, you recover 3
        Endurance points plus your favoured Heart rating.<br />
        When you are travelling, you recover normally (the reduced
        recovery rates found on page 11 do not apply to you).

    <div name="smallFolk" fullname="Small Folk">
        You have learnt how to gain an advantage in a fight from
        being smaller than most of your opponents. <br />
        When you are being attacked in close combat by a
        creature bigger than you (very often), your basic Parry
        rating is calculated using your favoured Wits score,
        instead of your basic Wits.<br />
        Outside of combat, you gain the ‘Small’ Trait, and can
        invoke it using the usual Trait rules (see the Traits chapter
        for details).

        Mirkwood is shunned by many men and beasts, yet its

        You are learning the ancient craft of concocting salves
        and herbal remedies from your village elders and wise-
        women. <br />
        You learn to recognise which herbs qualify as Fragrant
        Weeds when you first select this Virtue, and can master
        the secrets of  Poison Remedies as your undertaking
        during a Fellowship phase, and  spending one
        Experience point.<br />
        <b>Fragrant Weeds</b><br />
        You have developed the habit of chewing some herbs
        and roots that are said to bring vigour back into a man’s
        limbs. As long as you are in a wild area, you can collect
        enough herbs for their effect to be noticeable:<br />
        When your Endurance rating drops to equal or below
        your Fatigue score for the first time, you are not yet
        considered Weary. You become Weary only when your
        Endurance drops again.<br />
        <b>Poison Remedies</b><br />
        You can find the necessary ingredients to concoct a
        drink that, when ingested, will help a victim shake off
        the effects of spider-poison, or to prepare a salve that
        when applied to a wound or a bruise will neutralise the
        action of Orc-poison.<br />
        Spend a point of Hope and roll Craft against a TN of
        16 to neutralise the effects of a single poison type on all
        members of your Company.

    <div name="houndOfMirkwood" fullname="Hound of Mirkwood">
        Your folk have always delighted in training great, long-
        jawed hounds, stronger than wolves. You have chosen
        a wolfhound of Wilderland to accompany you in your
        wanderings and the faithfulness of your hound reinforces
        your spirit. <br />
        Raise your maximum Hope score by 2 points. <br />
        But such trust comes at a price: a Hound of Mirkwood
        is a valorous and noble beast, always ready to take the
        side of his human companion during combat.<br />
        When you are engaged in  battle, if an attack aimed
        at you produces an Eye Of Sauron result, the blow hits and
        automatically wounds the hound instead (in place of
        the effects of a normal hit). You may prevent this by
        taking the automatic wound yourself (you cannot roll for
        Protection). A wounded hound is put out of combat for
        the remainder of the scene, and will return at your side
        at the start of the next session only if you succeed in a
        Healing roll with a TN of 16. If you fail, the hound will
        not recover until the next Fellowship phase.<br />
        The training of a Hound of Mirkwood is an endeavour
        in itself; the teachings of Radagast have turned this
        craft into an art. When you first choose this Virtue,
        your hound learns to assist you with one Common skill
        as described under Support below, without paying the
        Experience point cost. You can train him to  Support
        additional skills, as well as to assist you in combat, as
        a separate undertaking during  later Fellowship phases,
        as follows:<br />
        <b>Support</b><br />
        You can train your hound to assist you in one activity.
        A dog can be trained to support you when making
        any  one of the following skill rolls: Awe, Awareness,
        Explore, or Hunting. It takes a Fellowship phase and
        one Experience point to teach your dog to complete an
        additional task.<br />
        When you are making a roll using one of the skills
        imparted to your dog, you may roll the Feat die twice,
        and keep the best result.<br />
        <b>Harass Enemy</b><br />
        You may spend a Fellowship phase and two Experience
        points to teach your animal companion to harass your
        opponent when fighting at close quarters.<br />
        When  you are fighting alongside your animal
        companion, your immediate adversary in close combat
        is always considered to be Weary.<br />
        <b>Protect</b><br />
        You may spend a Fellowship phase and one Experience
        point to teach your hound to steadfastly defend you
        when you withdraw to attack your enemies with a
        ranged weapon.<br />
        If you want to fight in a rearward stance, your dog protects
        you, counting as a companion fighting in a close combat
        stance (so that you need only another companion in
        close combat). Additionally, you are allowed to choose
        a rearward stance even if the total number of enemies is
        more than twice the number of companions (up to three
        times) - see Combat at page 156).

    <div name="naturalWatchfulness" fullname="Natural Watchfulness">
        Whether travelling, exploring or even resting, the
        behaviour of animals can communicate much to those
        who know how to interpret the signs. It could be the
        sudden silence of a bird, or the distant rustling of a beast
        in flight. You have learnt to recognise which sounds and
        sights reveal the approaching of enemies, and to read
        much from your surroundings. <br />
        When you are outside, you may upgrade the quality
        of a successful Awareness roll by one level, turning a
        success into a great success, or a great success into an
        extraordinary one. Additionally, during the day, you
        may make an  Explore roll with a TN of 14 to gather
        information regarding the area surrounding you, as if
        you were observing it from a vantage point (the top of a
        tall tree, a small hill).

        This song has been taught to the worthiest members of
        your clan since your people first descended along the

        a time of war and weapons, and its precious knowledge
        has been passed with great care from one generation to
        the next. Singing its words over a wound can reduce the
        loss of a warrior’s life-blood to a trickle, letting it flow
        back to the heart.<br />
        At the end of a fight you
        may roll  Song against TN 14. On a successful roll,
        you recover a number of additional Endurance points
        equal to your Wisdom rating, twice your Wisdom
        rating if the roll was a great success, or three times
        your Wisdom rating if the roll was an extraordinary
        success. Additionally, your injury is considered to have
        been treated successfully (see Chapter Four: Life and
        Death). You may spend a point of Hope to do the same
        for another member of your Company.

        It is said that every Dwarf that survived the Battle of

        a heavy burden, as he carried the weapons of those
        who died that day and whose bodies were burned in the

        used to disarm them.<br />
        If you roll a great or extraordinary success on an attack

        the preying claws of the Eagles of the Misty Mountains.<br />

        Impoverished people are probably suffering from a
        bad harvest season, a fell winter, or the aftermath of a
        disease or war. They struggle every day to find what they

        Frugal folk usually sleep in comfortable common halls
        (or tents, if nomadic) and eat the produce of their own
        lands and pastures. They wear simple clothes at most
        times, although they may possess finer garments for
        special gatherings like season festivals, marriages or
        funerals. Jewels and other superior ornaments, if any are
        in the keeping of members of the society, are treasured
        as possessions belonging to the community, and are
        passed down through generations of appointed keepers. <br />
        Adventurers coming from a Frugal folk do not usually
        carry anything of unusual worth (unless as part of their
        war gear), with the possible exception of one or two
        pieces of expensive clothing or common jewellery, like
        a rich mantle or a golden necklace or bracelet; probably
        a token of their status among their peers. Consequently,
        Frugal adventurers can rarely afford to pay for anything,
        and prefer to find or make what they need instead.

        Individuals belonging to a Martial culture often live

        of a renowned chieftain or noble. Meals are usually
        consumed in large halls, with seats and tables arranged
        to observe rules of precedence or respect. Clothing
        reflects the military status of an individual as well, or
        that of his family.<br />
        Martial player-heroes have enough resources to look
        after themselves, and to pay for such things as simple
        accommodation and meals. Ever mindful of the cost of
        any luxury, they often lead an austere life, or resort to

        Characters coming from a Prosperous culture can
        usually pay for their share of any out of pocket expense
        encountered along their journey, and might even pay
        for another companion, if need be. This includes, for
        example, paying for comfortable accommodation,

        Rich adventurers fare better than their Prosperous
        fellows, but not excessively so. Their life on the move

    <div name="leatherArmour" fullname="Leather armour">
        The simplest suit of armour available, leather armour
        is made of layers of cured and hardened animal hide
        sewn together. It is ideal for hunting or travelling as it is
        lightweight and comfortable, especially compared with
        mail armour. Leather armour may be crafted as a shirt,
        or a close-fitting corslet with long sleeves, extending its
        protection to the wearer’s hips.
    </div>
    <div name="mailArmour" fullname="Mail armour">
        The most effective type of armour encountered in Middle-
        earth at the end of the Third Age is mail armour: suits of
        close-fitting rings of metal, created to protect from cutting
        and thrusting weapons. From the shining hauberks of
        Elven lords to the black mail of Orc-chieftains, mail
        armour appears in widely different qualities. Ancient
        mail-coats of dwarf-make, when found, are matchless
        and prized possessions. <br />
        A mail shirt is a chain garment protecting the back, chest
        and abdomen of its wearer, while a coat of mail is a shirt
        with long sleeves. A mail hauberk is a longer coat with
        skirts of mail covering the knees of the wearer, making it
        ideal for those riding into battle.

    <div name="spiteful" fullname="Spiteful">
        The hero often repays real or imagined wrongs with
        vicious rudeness. Depending on the provocation, the hero
        may be simply very impolite, or downright insulting.
    </div>
    <div name="brutal" fullname="Brutal">
        A brutal hero reacts violently to provocations and shows
        little restraint under most circumstances.
    </div>
    <div name="cruel" fullname="Cruel">
        A cruel adventurer doesn’t care if his actions cause pain
        and suffering to others, and is needlessly savage with
        his enemies.
    </div>
    <div name="murderous" fullname="Murderous">
        A hero becomes murderous when he starts to consider
        killing as a perfectly natural way to achieve a goal or
        simply to make things go his way.
    </div>
    <div name="grasping" fullname="Grasping">
        Grasping describes the desire to accumulate gold
        and precious items above all else, just for the sake of
        possessing them.
    </div>
    <div name="mistrustful" fullname="Mistrustful">
        When your prized possessions start to weigh you down
        and become a treasure to be guarded, even the good
        advice of friends appears to mask dubious intentions.
    </div>
    <div name="deceitful" fullname="Deceitful">
        A deceitful adventurer feels no shame in misleading
        others with lies and stratagems, as long as his
        machinations further his ends and needs.
    </div>
    <div name="thieving" fullname="Thieving">
        A thieving adventurer has discovered that anything he
        desires can be his – he just has to take it. He earned the
        right to take all he wants when he sacrificed the love of
        his peers and his own self-respect.
    </div>
    <div name="resentful" fullname="Resentful">
        A resentful adventurer is often bitter and angry with the

        life for individuals that fail to recognise his actions on
        their behalf.
    </div>
    <div name="arrogant" fullname="Arrogant">
        An arrogant hero doesn’t miss an opportunity to
        underline his own importance, often belittling his peers
        and companions.
    </div>
    <div name="overconfident" fullname="Overconfident">
        Overconfidence denotes overweening pride, a sentiment
        that blinds a hero to his own limits and weaknesses.
        He will set out to do anything he sets his mind upon,
        regardless of the consequences that might befall others.
    </div>
    <div name="tyrannical" fullname="Tyrannical">
        A tyrannical hero escalates his actions and desires to the
        level of a just cause. His disregard for the lives of others
        is so profound that he will go to any length to achieve
        his ends, regardless of the cost or methods employed to
        accomplish them. Any dissenting opinion is considered
        as utter betrayal.
    </div>
    <div name="haughty" fullname="Haughty">
        A haughty character doesn’t recognise easily the wisdom
        found in the words and actions of others, and tends to

    </div>
    <div name="scornful" fullname="Scornful">

    </div>
    <div name="scheming" fullname="Scheming">
        A scheming adventurer keeps his thoughts and intentions
        to himself at all times, never giving advice and heeding
        only his own judgment. He might sometimes agree with
        the propositions of others, but only to be free to follow
        his own choices later.
    </div>
    <div name="treacherous" fullname="Treacherous">
        When an adventurer becomes treacherous he cannot be
        trusted to keep his word. He is ready to betray his own
        friends and allies if it would be to his advantage.
    </div>
    <div name="idle" fullname="Idle">
        It takes a lot to stir an idle adventurer into action. He is
        easily distracted, and must be cajoled to fully participate
        in endeavours.
    </div>
    <div name="forgetful" fullname="Forgetful">
        Forgetful indicates that a hero is often daydreaming and
        absentminded, and finds it difficult to remember even
        important things.
    </div>
    <div name="uncaring" fullname="Uncaring">
        An uncaring adventurer is losing touch with the world
        outside of himself. He can’t bring himself to feel
        compassion and quickly loses interest in matters that do
        not concern him directly.
    </div>
    <div name="cowardly" fullname="Cowardly">
        A cowardly hero cares only for his own safety under any
        circumstances, and will go to any length to save himself

        You can use this Dice Roller for playing online. If you open the chat window, rolls you make will appear there for others to see.<br />
        The Dice Roller has seven buttons representing the different amounts of dice you can roll in the game:
        <ul>
            <li>
                If you want to roll only the Feat die, click on the Feat button.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you want to roll the Feat die plus three Success dice, click on the button labeled 3.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can type a number in the text box for making rolls with a given modifier. For example, for rolling the Feat die and 2 Success dice with a modifier of +3
                type a 3 in the text box, then click on the button labeled 2. All rolls made until you empty the text box will have that +3 modifier.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can make a roll like if the character is Weary. For that, put a checkmark on the Weary checkbox. Success dice with values 1, 2 or 3 will show 0 instead.

            <li>
                You can roll the Feat die twice and keep the best or worst result. For that, check one of the two corresponding checkboxes. Rolls made will have the Feat die rolled
                twice and discarded one of the results.
            </li>
        </ul>
        You don't need to use the dice roller for creating characters.

    <div name="uiTutOnlineWelcome" fullname="Welcome to the Online Server">
        Welcome to the <b>Online Character Server</b>.<br />
        Here you can create groups of characters to share with your friends and with other people.
        The character data is stored on the server for free.<br />
        You can use these features to host an online game. With the chat you will be able to share dice rolls.<br />
        When you save a character in the server, you and your friends will be able to open its character sheet and update it on the run.
    </div>
    <div name="uiTutOnlineGroup" fullname="Character Group">
        The first thing you will need to have to be able to use the full potential of the Online Server is to create your own Character Group.<br />
        If you don't have one (and if this is your first time here you will likely have none) you will have to create one.<br />
        When you create a Character Group you must choose a Public Group Name (that will be shown to everyone), and a private login and password<br />
        <br />
        Click on Next to go on...
    </div>
    <div name="uiTutOnlineGroup2" fullname="Character Group">
        Click on this button. You will be asked, in this order, for a Public Group Name. Type something like "Trotter's TOR Campaign".<br />
        Then you will be asked for a login username. Type something secret but easy to retype and remember, like "trot92" without the quotes.<br />
        Then you will be prompted for a password. Type something secret but easy to retype and remember, like "snarling honey elephant" without the quotes.<br />
        Don't choose a login username or a password that are easy to guess from the Public Group Name. If other people guess your credentials, your characters could be vandalized!<br />
        <br />
        Click on that button and provide the information required, then click on Next to go on...<br />
        If you have a group already, then skip this step by clicking on Next to go on...<br />
    </div>
    <div name="uiTutOnlineGroup3" fullname="Character Group Credentials">
        If everything went well, you have created your own Character Group in the server. If an error happened it could be that you provided invalid username or password or they have been taken already before.<br />
        Now type your username and password in these cells. As long as you have your username and password in these cells, you will be interacting with your Character Group.<br />
        The page will remember the credentials you type here everytime you come back using this same browser in this computer.<br />
        If you have several character groups and you want to switch between them, just change the credentials in these cells. You don't need to click anywhere else to log in or anything.<br />
        <br />
        Type your credentials on these cells, then click on Next to go on...
    </div>
    <div name="uiTutOnlineGroup4" fullname="Public Characters">
        As players store characters into the server, other players can see them too (but not modify them, of course). This could be useful as a repository of ready-made characters for fast games.<br />
        Click on this button to get a list of all characters that have been stored into the server. It will list their names, culture, calling and the character group they belong to.<br />
        If you want to open the character sheet of any of them, click on the Load button next to them. The character sheet will be filled with their stats.<br />
        <br />
        Click the button, then load any character, then click on Next to go on...
    </div>

    <div name="uiTutOnlineGroup5" fullname="Saving Characters">
        When you create a character with the Character Creator you can save it into your Character Group.<br />
        You can also load a public character and save a copy of it into your Character Group.<br />
        The most important part is that you can't have more than one character with the same name in your Group. If you attempt to save a second character with the same name as one in your Group, the second character will replace the first one.<br />
        If you want to modify a character and save the changes back into the server, just leave the same name and the new version of the character will replace the old one.<br />
        <br />
        Click on Next to go on...
    </div>

    <div name="uiTutOnlineGroup6" fullname="Saving Characters">
        Let's try it out!<br />
        Load a random character from the public list of all characters!<br />
        <br />
        Click on a Load button, then click on Next to go on...
    </div>

    <div name="uiTutOnlineGroup7" fullname="Saving Characters">
        Now move the Online Server window to a side if needed so that you can see the Name field in the character sheet.<br />
        Modify that name to something different. For example, rename that character to Aragorn.<br />
        If you want, change also some other things in the character sheet. Like some skill ranks or attribute values.<br />
        <br />
        Rename the character, then click on Next to go on...
    </div>

    <div name="uiTutOnlineGroup7_1" fullname="Saving Characters">
        Now go back to the Online Server window and click on the Save button.<br />
        The character will be saved into your Group with the name you chose.<br />
        <br />
        Click on the Save button, then click on Next to go on...
    </div>

    <div name="uiTutOnlineGroup8" fullname="Saving Characters">
        When you save a character, the character list changes to display the list of characters on your Group. You can always get this list by clicking on this button.<br />
        Now you know how to copy, modify and save a character into your group. Next we will learn how to delete it.<br />
        <br />
        Click on Next to go on...
    </div>

    <div name="uiTutOnlineGroup9" fullname="Deleting Characters">
        To delete a character just click on the Delete button next to it. It will ask for confirmation.<br />
        Once a character is deleted there is no way back. Poof. It's gone forever. Be careful.<br />
        Let's delete the character you just saved. Click on his delete button.<br />
        <br />
        Click on the Delete button of the character, then confirm, then click on Next to go on...
    </div>

    <div name="uiTutOnlineGroup10" fullname="Chat">
        The chat is very simple to use, but it makes sense only if more than one person is going to use it, of course.<br />
        For this tutorial, you can open another browser tab or window that will act as an imaginary friend if you want to try it out.<br />
        The chat will only work when two or more people have entered the Group credentials and they open the chat window by clicking on this button.<br />
        <br />
        Click on the button, then click on Next to go on...
    </div>

    <div name="uiTutOnlineGroup11" fullname="Chat">
        First and foremost, select an alias for you. Just type your name here.<br />
        <br />
        Type your name in this text box, then click on Next to go on...
    </div>

    <div name="uiTutOnlineGroup12" fullname="Chat">
        Then you can type messages in this box here. If you have a friend doing the same (or yourself in another browser tab or window) you will see their message appear.<br />
        <br />
        Type something and press Enter to send it, then click on Next to go on...
    </div>

    <div name="uiTutOnlineGroup13" fullname="Dice Rolls in the Chat">
        The chat is not great compared to other chat services. What it is most useful for is for rolling dice during an online game.<br />
        Find the Dice Roller panel (it may be below the Online Server window, the Chat window or this tutorial window, move them away) and make a roll.<br />
        The roll will be sent to other people in your group connected to the chat.<br />
        <br />
        Roll some dice, then click on Next to go on...
    </div>

    <div name="uiTutOnlineGroup13_2" fullname="Chat Close">
        Use this button to close the chat window.<br />
        <br />
        Click the Close button, then click on Next to go on...
    </div>

    <div name="uiTutOnlineGroup14" fullname="Chat Log">
        This button is used to recover all the chat message you have had in the past, in case you want to remember what happened.<br />
        <br />
        Click on Next to go on...
    </div>

    <div name="uiTutOnlineGroup15" fullname="Chat Log">
        This button is used for the same, but instead of opening the chat window to show the chat history, it will offer it in a file for download.<br />

    <div name="lakeman" fullname="Man of the Lake">
        The Men of the lake distinguish themselves from their neighbours, the inhabitants of Dale, by their greater love for 'modern' things and exotic novelties,
        a contrast with the Bardings' healthier respect for tradition.
        Where the wealthiest among the men and women of dale display their status
        wearing gold bracelets and torques, or pins and brooches with precious stones,
        the inhabitants of Lake-town favour rich furs
        and fine-woven fabrics, often the product of foreign craftmanship. Their differences
        extend beyond mere appearance though: Bardings are said to prize nobility and lineage, while Lake-men
        value above all men or women who elevate themselves through resourcefulness and daring.
    </div>

    <div name="tenacious" fullname="Tenacious">
        The Men of Esgaroth are quick to find and exploit the positive
        in everything they experience, however little it seems. Every defeat is a chance to learn, every blow suffered is a lesson taken by heart.
        <br />
        • When a Man of the lake is wounded, or fails at a roll with seriously negative consequences, he may spend a point of Hope to earn an Experience point.
        Eligible rolls are, for example, all Fear tests made during combat, all Corruption tests, or any failed roll deemed suitable by the Loremaster.
    </div>

    <div name="lakemanBackground1" fullname="Legends spring to life">
        Your old nanny taught you many songs about the Dwarf-kings of the Mountain, and you grew up thinking that their halls of stone were as real
        as the bone-littered cave of the Mash-ogre she told you about when you misbehaved. Now you know that dreams and legends are real,
        and that there are treasures and wonderful new lands out there, waiting for you to go and seek them out.
    </div>

    <div name="lakemanBackground2" fullname="Restless pupil">
        Your father spent much of his hard-earned gold on your education, to make sure that one day his rigtful heir could aspire to the loftiest positions in the city council.
        But you seemed able to focus only on miths and legends, your single-mindedness finally proving too much for your teachers and your father's patience. Soon you will have to make a choice:
        to renounce your dreams or take the road as an adventurer, to be soon forsaken by your family in favour of your younger siblings - unless you return as a hero.
    </div>
    <div name="lakemanBackground3" fullname="Masterful fingers">
        Everyone who knows you has, at least once, seen you sitting for long hours at your hearth or on the steps of the market-square quays with your knife in hand, whittling
        pieces of wood into animals, blossoms and leaves. Your ability has even drawn comments from passing raft-elves, their praise music to your ears: you feel a measure of kinship
        with those graceful and silent forest-dwelling people, and you will one day go and visit their halls with many pillars, to see with your eyes the fabled carven throne of the Elvenking.

    </div>
    <div name="lakemanBackground4" fullname="Lordling">
        You are born into a family of envoys and diplomats, serving the city council of Esgaroth and its Master for countless generations.
        Your manners are so naturally dignified that you could have passed for the heir of a noble house - if you weren't born in a town where
        the only lords are merchant princes. But you don't see that as a flaw; where you are planning to go, the actions of an individual are not lessened
        in worth by lack of a proper lineage.
    </div>
    <div name="lakemanBackground5" fullname="Watchmen">
        You, your father and his father before him served in the city watch, until the town was incinerated by the fiery death throes of the Dragon.
        When you saw the great beast fall from the sky, you realised how countless years looking at the distant Mountain had been spent in vain -
        for of what use is a watchman when his warning is not heeded by heroes who can do something about the coming threat?
    </div>
    <div name="lakemanBackground6" fullname="Innocence lost">
        When you were a kid you could be seen running starry-eyed along the busy streets of the city,
        pulling pranks with your friends on noble emissaries, rich merchants, shady traders, even silent sell-swords and menacing cutthroats.
        Your stare lost its innocence when one night your older brother disappeared after a night of drunken revelry.
        You don't know what happened to him - he may have fallen into the water, but you know well that in Lake-town even drunk men know not
        to walk close to the edge of the quays...

    <div name="minstrelsy" fullname="Minstrelsy">
        You have been trained in the arts of singing and playing one or more musical instruments,
        according to the tradition of the wandering minstrels. Your musical lore runs deeper than most,
        as you partake of the knowledge of musicians coming from foreign lands.
    </div>

    <div name="bowmanOfTheGuild" fullname="Bowman of the Guild">
        You have demonstrated a talent worthy of admission to the Bowmen's Guild of Esgaroth,
        a honourable association uniting the best archers of Lake-town. Now you may train and
        share secrets of the trade with many old friends of Bard the Bowman himself, all veterans of the Battle of Five Armies.
        <br />
        • Raise your Standing by 1 point. Additionally, from now on, when you are using a bow or a great bow,
        you may spend a point of Hope to upgrade the quality of a successful attack roll by one level,
        turning a success into a great success, or a great success into an extraordinary one.

    <div name="merchantPrince" fullname="Merchant Prince">
        Your family's fortune is rising with the reopening of the trading routes that lead to the markets in the South and East.
        This increased affluence has started to positively affect your adventuring life, as you may choose a servant from those employed
        in your household and have him join you in your next endeavour. At the start of an Adventuring phase you may pick one
        servant to accompany you:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Page: a page assists you in all your daily routines, like washing and dressing, and takes care of your clothes and gear.
                He is at your side during any encounter, making sure that you are properly introduced and providing advice and counsel.
                When you enjoy the help of a page, you can roll the Feat die twice and keep the best result when you are making any Courtesy and Insight rolls.
            </li>
            <li>
                Physician: a physician is an older servant who has long been trained in the arts of taking care of your health. He knows every little
                ailment you might have suffered from since you were a child, and possesses the knowledge to prepare a remedy. As long as you are assisted
                by a physician, you can roll the Feat die twice and keep the best result when you are making a Healing roll.
            </li>
            <li>
                Porter: a porter helps you in carrying your gear when you are adventuring. When you are making a Fatigue test, you can roll the Feat die
                twice and keep the best result.
            </li>
            <li>
                Scrivener: a scrivener is a personal servant who can read and write. He is usually well-learned and keeps a daily record of your exploits,
                if you are employing a scrivener you can roll the Feat die twice and keep the best result when you are making any Lore and Riddle rolls.
            </li>
        </ul>
        With the exception of a physician, a servant in a rich trading family is usually a young boy, often a minor relative of modest ambition.
        Regardless of his duty, your servant is no fighting man, but is considered to be always around and eager to perform his assigned task.
    </div>
    <div name="shieldFighting" fullname="Shield-fighting">
        You have learnt to wield a shield like the boatmen of Esgaroth do when they fight to repel enemies trying to board their ships.
        <br />
        • If you are fighting using a shield of any type, when you successfully hit an enemy roll the Feat die again: on a roll of 8+ you inflict
        an additional loss of Endurance equal to your Damage rating plus the Encumbrance value of the shield you are using (1 for Buckler, 3 for Shield, 5 for Great Shield).
    </div>
    <div name="tradersSavvy" fullname="Trader's Savvy">
        Some say that "fair speech may hide a foul heart", but you have lived among merchants and traders long enough to know that pleasant words
        are always received better than harsh ones when dealing with strangers.
        <br />
        • When you are about to play out an encounter, you can attempt to raise its Tolerance rating making a roll with any custom skill
        (Song, Courtesy or Riddle) against TN 14. On a successful roll, add +1 to the Tolerance of the encounter, +2 if the roll was a great success,
        or +3 if the roll was an extraordinary success.
    </div>
    <div name="waterLegs" fullname="Water Legs">
        Life on the lake has taught you how to move appropriately when on board a moving boat. Now that you have taken up adventuring you can exploit
        your superior balance to your advantage even when you are on dry land.
        <br />
        • When an opponent is attacking you in combat, before the dice are rolled, you may spend a bonus Success die due to a Combat advantage
        to get a bonus of +3 to your Parry score. Additionally, if you are fighting on a boat, a raft, or other precarious or risky surface
        (for example, an Elven tree platform, a rope bridge) you receive one free Combat advantage bonus die during Onset.
    </div>
    <div name="brazenArmour" fullname="Brazen Armour">
        (mail armour)
        <br />
        Men-folk out of the East favour suits of armour made of overlapping brass plates, or composed of small scales arranged in a mesh, like the
        scales on a fish or the feathers of birds. Many of these elaborate coats have been hanging on the walls of the great hall of Lake-town,
        waiting for heroes worthy to wear them.
        <br />
        • A Brazen armour is the equivalent of a suit of mail armour, but wearing it allows you to roll one additional Success die on a Protection
        roll against an attack made with a edged or blunt melee weapon (swords, axes and clubs), and one Success die less against spears and arrows,
        or other types of penetrating attacks.
    </div>
    <div name="keeningBogStone" fullname="Keening Bog-Stone">
        Among the most unusual and rare possessions of a lake-men household are these unassuming whetstones, small flat pebbles never bigger than
        a pigeon egg, black in colour and faintly traced with green veins. They can be obtained from the oldest and most superstitious fishermen
        of the town, who swear they get them in exchange for iron tool offerings left in certain areas of the Long Marshes.
        <br />
        • If you carry a Keening Bog-stone in a pouch or wear it as a necklace, it vibrates and emits a soft wailing sound when a creature possessing
        the Hate Sunlight or Denizen of the Dark special abilities is close (within 100 yards). Additionally, the first attack you aim at such a
        creature will provoke an additional loss of a point of Hate.
    </div>
    <div name="serpentScimitar" fullname="Serpent Scimitar">
        (sword)
        <br />
        Exotic blades from the distant South are the most sought-after collector's items among the more fashionable merchants of Lake-town.
        Most of those that find their way to the North are useless ceremonial blades of cheaply damasked iron, with lacquered hilts and scabbards
        set with coloured stones. A rare few are the work of truly superior craftsmanship, quick and deadly weapons in the hand of a skilled fighter.
        <br />
        • When making a melee attack using a Serpent scimitar, ignore any Parry rating bonus your target has that is due to them carrying a shield.

        The Woodmen of Mountain Hall are cousins and
        oathbrothers to the Woodmen of Mirkwood, and live in a
        long steep-sided valley near the head of the river Icewater.
        <br />
        Their Mountain Hall — Firienseld in the language of the
        Vales of Anduin — is an easily defended burg in the shadow
        of the mountains, built atop their mines. It needs every wall
        and trench, as the Goblins often threaten the Hall.

    </div>
    <div name="mountainFighters" fullname="Mountain Fighters">
        The Woodmen of Firienseld have learned how to put
        the unforgiving features of the mountains to their
        advantage when they are involved in a fight.
        <br />
        • When the Woodmen fight in the mountains, they
        use their favoured Wits score as their basic Parry
        rating.

    <div name="hobbitVA" fullname="Wild Hobbit of the Valley of Anduin">
        Many people believe wild Hobbits to be nothing more
        than children’s stories, but the truth is that a few
        halflings still live in the region about the Gladden
        Fields. They don’t live in comfortable Hobbit-holes,
        but hide under the eaves of Mirkwood or dig a refuge
        along the river-bank for a night and move on. They
        have little contact with the humans of the region;
        the dangers of Wilderland have turned them into
        a secretive, shy folk, quite unlike their sedentary,
        settled cousins of Eriador. They play little part in
        the affairs of the region, and consider most humans
        to be as dangerous and oversized as Orcs. Only a few
        trustworthy people, mostly River-folk, know where
        these halflings make their home.
    </div>
    <div name="shadowSight" fullname="Shadow-Sight">
        The wild Hobbits of the Vales of Anduin who survived
        the coming of the Shadow over Mirkwood have been
        made tougher by the experience, and are more aware
        of its threats. They have learned to recognise the
        presence of its minions and the traces of his devilry.
        <br />
        • When a wild Hobbit makes a HUNTING or
        AWARENESS roll to track or perceive the
        proximity of an evil creature or a servant of the
        Shadow, he adds his Attribute score to the result,
        as if enjoying an Attribute bonus. Additionally,
        when making a Corruption test to resist the taint
        of a blighted place, wild Hobbits can roll the Feat
        die twice and keep the best result.
    </div>
    <div name="theCallOfMirkwood" fullname="The Call of Mirkwood">
        You think your fate and that of your race should be that of enjoying life to the fullest, as long as Mirkwood and
        the world endure. You accept the price of this choice: you will dwindle and fade until you become a living memory, a

        assure that the will of your lord and the safety of Erebor

        no amount of toil can dint your spirits. During what now

        have a dour look about them and suspicion ever in their

        of all those belonging to Durin’s Folk, a politeness that

        is probably due to their knowledge of the ways of many

        lands. Often bent over with toil, they sometimes seem

        slightly shorter than their kin – though when they stand

        tall their Longbeard ancestry reveals itself, especially in

        their proud noses and piercing eyes.<br />

        Typically, the Dwarves of the Grey Mountains carry the

        tools of their craft with them at almost all times, ever ready

        for the next opportunity to ply their trade. When they do

        were well enough to begin a search. You did not have to

        The first Dwarves of the Ered Luin were the hardy warriors of Nogrod

        craftsmen, and great haters of Orcs and Dragons, their power
        was ended when their mansions were drowned in the breaking of
        Beleriand.<br />
        In the twilight of the Third Age, the Dwarves of the Ered
        Luin are loyal subjects of the King of Durin’s Folk, as
        their halls were founded anew when Thráin the Second

        until a lady in a high office felt insulted by your behaviour,
        described by her as ‘ill-advised’. Since that day, you have
        left behind the gates of the halls of your Lord, vowing
        never to return. Who needs a palace when you can tread
        the many-pillared paths of Mirkwood? Your kin was born
        to see the stars, not to skulk in a darkened fortress under
        the earth.
    </div>
    <div name="waywardElfBackground4" fullname="Root Seeker">
        You have listened to the words of the seers of Mirkwood,
        and read ancient chronicles in the Halls of the Woodland
        Realm. But you long to hear the tales that are told beyond
        the borders of your land and hear the songs that your
        kin compose in Lothlórien and Rivendell! Your folk is
        ancient beyond the reckoning of Mortals, and you yearn
        to discover your roots.
    </div>
    <div name="waywardElfBackground5" fullname="Hunter">
        You delight in the thrill of the chase, with bow or spear,
        hawk or hound and, for those who dare to brave its depths,
        Mirkwood is the greatest of hunting grounds. You have
        rejected the tired and formulaic hunts of Thranduil’s kingdom
        for the wilder hunt, unplanned and without pageantry, deep
        in the heart of the forest. You against the Wild.
    </div>
    <div name="waywardElfBackground6" fullname="Wanderer">
        You have always felt more inspired by the night sky than
        the trees of Mirkwood. Your eyes are ever turned upwards
        and you have long wandered under the light of the Moon.
        For many long nights you have been drawn deeper and
        deeper into the darkness of Mirkwood, yet you have
        always found your way back to a place of safety. But the
        stars are pulling you further and further away, further
        down the road and towards the horizon.
    </div>
    <div name="wineOfTheDarkMountains" fullname="Wine of the Dark Mountains">
        (Requires The Call of Mirkwood virtue)<br />
        When you drink from the Wine of the Dark Mountains
        before a battle, you start combat with an additional
        number of temporary Endurance points equal to twice
        your Valour score.
    </div>
    <div name="manOfBreeBackground1" fullname="Crossroads of the North">
        Your family has run a business in Bree since time
        immemorial, serving the needs of the Bree-landers and
        the strangers who come up from the south or east, or the
        Little Folk from the west. Why, your grandfather even once
        had Elves on his doorstep, as plain as day – and indeed,
        their coin was as good as anyone else’s. You worked in
        the family business when you were younger, until a great
        desire came upon you to follow the Road and see where all
        those strangers and their gold come from.
    </div>
    <div name="manOfBreeBackground2" fullname="Off with Dwarves">
        Dwarf-miners and traders passing through Bree on their
        way to their mansions in the Blue Mountains took you
        with them as a caravan guard, and you became friends
        (if friendship is the right word for the grudging, slow-won
        respect of that grim folk). In time, you returned home to
        Bree, but wanderlust soon put your feet back on the road
        – only now you march in time to the walking songs of
        Durin’s folk.
    </div>
    <div name="manOfBreeBackground3" fullname="From the Chetwood">
        Your kin dwell in the Chetwood, the forest east of Bree.
        Most of the forest is safe and wholesome, but parts –
        especially near the Midgewater Marshes – have their
        own perils, and as a child you learned to find food that
        was safe to eat near certain old trees that whispered
        to one another in the night. It was worth creeping out
        of Archet-village and risking the dangers of the wood,
        though, because on some nights, you could hear Elvish
        singing on the wind when the Wandering Companies
        passed by.
    </div>
    <div name="manOfBreeBackground4" fullname="Gate-Warden">
        The gates of Bree and the other villages are locked at
        night, to keep out those that would make trouble… and
        other things, too. You were one of the wardens, and spent
        many cold, lonely nights on watch, with only the stars and
        hooting owls for company.
    </div>
    <div name="manOfBreeBackground5" fullname="Came up the Greenway">
        Your grandfather was not born in the Bree-land. He made
        a long and arduous journey up from the South, across the
        Gap of Rohan from beyond the Isen. He crossed the river on
        the bridge at Tharbad with his wife and three children and
        settled here in the vale by Bree-hill. The North is cold and
        wild compared to the lands where your grandfather was
        born, but the tales he used to tell about the fierce kings of
        the South never made you doubt his choice.
    </div>
    <div name="manOfBreeBackground6" fullname="No Longer Free from Care and Fear">
        It was many years ago that you discovered something that
        not many in the Bree-land even suspect: the region is far
        from being safe - it is a secluded shelter, a small island
        surrounded by unseen foes. You haven’t told anyone as
        you fear they won’t believe you. But you know for sure,
        because you have been about with a group of Outsiders…
        They are called Rangers in Bree, and not much is made of
        them, but they taught you to look for useful things in the
        wild. Now you know where to find shelter and supplies,
        a knowledge you will soon make use of, for the day when
        you will go out and look for them is near.
    </div>
    <div name="uiRollMasteryDice" fullname="Mastery dice to roll">
        Roll this many additional success dice. After rolling, the same amount of dice with the lowest results will be discarded.

            </li>
            <li>
                The Online Server window has seen its layout changed. Thanks Garn for the suggestion.
            </li>
            <li>
                Added a new button to the main menu to hide all volatile cells for printing. The volatile cells are those whose values are prone to change often during a game or after character development and you would like them being blank for printing. Thanks Thriddle for the suggestion!

            <li>
                All characters stored in the server are now viewable by anyone.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Added Carried checkboxes to all weapon gear and armor gear rows. When marked, that gear is considered to be carried by the character, and its Encumbrance value
                will be added to the Fatigue. When not marked, it is owned by the character but left at home or carried by a mule.<br />
                When you load your character for first time after this change, you will have all gear off. Just mark the ones you want to carry back on.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can now remove a weapon skill without removing the whole row.

                Cosmetic change: Fixed black page printing in Chrome. <br />
                Cosmetic change: Changed all fonts to printable ones. Because of an unfixed bug in Firefox itself, you can't get the webfonts printed in that browser. They have to fix that.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fixed page not rememebering Font selection or What's New read status.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fixed backspace not working on text fields, or Enter not working on the Culture Selection window.
            </li>
        </ul>
        February 21st, 2012<br />
        <ul>
            <li>
                Fixed the problem with mobile browsers not showing the page. Sorry!
            </li>
            <li>
                Print button removed. Use your browser's print command to print instead. Fixed the back background on the print preview in Chrome. (Still some glitches)
            </li>
            <li>
                You can now change the fonts in the page to the previous ones by clicking the Change Font button. It will remember your selection.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can now change how the popup descriptions of game items work. <br />
                By default, when hovering the mouse over a game items, a little (?) button will appear next to it.
                Click on that button to get a window with the description of the item.<br />
                Alternatively you can click the Popup Help Buttons button to change back to the classic popup tooltips.<br />
                You can click the Popup Tooltips button again to remove any kind of popup help.<br />
                You can click again to go back to popup buttons. The page will remember your selection.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Character Creation wizard has now bigger buttons to help using it in smaller screen mobile devices. <br />
                Also, it has now a Cancel Creation button that will close the wizard and restore the character sheet you had before, regardless of in which stage of the creation you cancelled.<br />
                Also, you can now press Enter for Next, Backspace for Previous and Escape for Cancel Creation.
            </li>
            <li>
                The What's New button will now be highlighted when there are changes you have not yet read about. ;)
            </li>
            <li>
                The Dice Roller will show in the chat if the roll was made adding (or substracting) any modifier.
            </li>
            <li>
                Several cosmetic tweaks.
            </li>
            <li>
                Experimental new online feature: Synchronization.<br />
                When you load an online character, you can enable the new Synchronize Changes button.<br />
                While the button is enabled, all changes made to the character will be sent to the server. <br />
                The program will check for changes from the server and bring them to update the sheet.<br />
                This feature should be useful during online games where the same sheet is open by the Loremaster and the players.
                If both load the character from the server and both enable Synchronization, they will see eachother's changes appear automatically.<br />
                Please understand that this feature is experimental and you may encounter some glitches. Please, report any bugs. Thanks! :)
