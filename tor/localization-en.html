	<div id="locale" style="display: none;">
		<div name="personality" fullname="Personality">
			A hero’s personality comes through in his capacity to 
			impress, encourage and influence others. A good level 
			of proficiency in all three skills in this group is the mark 
			of a leader.
		</div>
		<div name="movement" fullname="Movement">
			Overcoming obstacles, enduring long journeys and 
			moving secretly are the stuff adventurers are made of. 
		</div>
		<div name="perception" fullname="Perception">
			The ability to catch hidden details often pays off, be it 
			noticing an odd noise that gives away an ambusher, 
			catching the gleam in the eyes of a liar or spotting the 
			crack in the wall that reveals a secret door. 
		</div>
		<div name="survival" fullname="Survival">
			The three skills of this group, essential for a roving
			adventurer, make a hero an invaluable member of a
			company.
		</div>
		<div name="custom" fullname="Custom">
			While heroes are often held to be uncivilised brutes 
			by the common folk, their lives can sometimes depend 
			on knowing the proper words, wisest song or cleverest 
			answer. Excelling in these skills is considered a noble 
			achievement. 
		</div>
		<div name="vocation" fullname="Vocation">
			Before his resolve hardened and pushed a hero on his 
			road to adventure, he probably led a life much like an 
			ordinary individual of his folk; learning a trade, defending 
			his people and absorbing their accumulated wisdom
		</div>
		<div name="awe" fullname="Awe">
			This skill measures a hero’s capacity to provoke respect in 
			onlookers, and determines the impression a hero makes 
			on someone he meets for the first time. Depending on the 
			circumstances and the hero’s intentions or disposition, 
			it can be used to instil wonderment, admiration, or even 
			fear.  Awe arises from a character’s native charisma, 
			but can also be engineered with a dramatic entrance or 
			impressive attire.	<br/>
			A successful use of the skill provokes the chosen effect. A 
failure fails to have any impact, or can even lead to the 
opposite result! Achieving a great success means that 
the hero has won the hearts of the onlookers, or cowed 
them into silent submission. An extraordinary success 
may produce open reverence, or panic.
		</div>
		<div name="inspire" fullname="Inspire">
		A hero able to Inspire others can instil positive feelings 
in others, urging them to act on the matter at hand. This 
is a feat achieved mainly through example, charisma and 
personal conviction, rather than through the effective 
use of words (which falls under  Persuade, below). It 
can be used on individuals, but is especially effective in 
influencing crowds. Heroes with high  Inspire ratings 
can be forceful orators, passionate agitators, and well-
loved leaders of men.<br/>
A successful Inspire roll awakens a chosen feeling in the 
subject, so long as it is not in opposition to their current 
mood. A great success is enough to influence wholly 
disinterested individuals, and an extraordinary success 
may turn rivals into supporters.  
		</div>
		<div name="persuade" fullname="Persuade">
		This skill allows a hero to apply his or her reasoning to 
convince another individual of an idea or course of action. 
It can be used to influence small groups of listeners, but 
only if used in an appropriate context, such as a common 
hall. An attempt at persuasion requires more time than 
other  Personality skills, but can have a more lasting 
impact on other characters’ actions. A high  Persuade 
score denotes an uncommon eloquence, a love of speech 
and knowledge of its proper use and its effect on listeners. 
Wise men, advisors to chieftains and kings and their 
messengers all share this passion for the spoken word. 
<br />
The successful use of the skill lets the hero convince his 
audience of the flaws in their current position. A great 
success convinces the subject of the quality of the hero’s 
stance, while an extraordinary success may turn the 
subject into an ardent believer.
		</div>
		<div name="athletics" fullname="Athletics">
		Athletics is a broad skill, covering most of the physical 
activities that a hero might undertake while adventuring, 
including running, leaping, climbing, swimming and 
throwing stones or other small objects. Heroes with high 
Athletics skill scores exhibit a winning combination 
of physical prowess, grace and control, generally 
gained through continuous exercise and daily exertion. <br/>
A successful  Athletics roll produces a satisfactory 
outcome in the physical activity, while a failed roll 
might even lead to serious harm, depending on the 
circumstances. A great or extraordinary result suggests 
a spectacular achievement.
		</div>
		<div name="travel" fullname="Travel">
		In the Third Age, the cities, villages and towns of Middle-
earth are often separated by many leagues of wild or 
deserted areas. Roads that used to lead safely to distant 
realms now end in broken trails that go nowhere. 
When the company  needs to cover a distance across 
uncertain territory, 
including by boat, 
every companion is 
required to perform 
one or more tests 
using the Travel skill 
to avoid becoming 
weary too soon. While 
certainly the product 
of experience, the 
use of Travel benefits 
mostly from a hero’s 
strength of spirit. 
		</div>
		<div name="stealth" fullname="Stealth">
		A hero resorts to Stealth whenever he needs, or is forced, 
to act in a furtive or secret way. The skill includes hiding, 
moving quietly and shadowing others. These activities 
often rely on quickness and precision, so a stealthy hero 
combines practiced caution with the ability to judge the 
right moment to take a chance. Hunters, burglars, and 
solitary fighters use Stealth to prosper in their trade. <br/>
A successful  Stealth roll indicates that the character 
has gone unnoticed, while a failure has almost certainly 
attracts unwanted attention. <br/>
A great or extraordinary success produces an outcome 
so flawless that it even be impossible to trace the hero’s 
actions after the fact. 
		</div>
		<div name="awareness" fullname="Awareness">
		The Awareness skill represents a hero’s readiness to react 
and his ability to notice something unexpected, out of 
the ordinary, or 
difficult to detect. 
High skill reflects 
both keen senses 
and the experience 
to understand what 
you see and hear. <br/>
A high Awareness 
rating expresses 
an extraordinary 
watchfulness, and 
is extremely useful 
to a companion 
who serves as a 
look-out for the 
company.
		</div>
		<div name="insight" fullname="Insight">
		Insight is the ability of a hero to see beyond appearances, 
recognising people’s hidden thoughts and beliefs. Heroes 
with Insight can recognise when someone is lying, and 
can draw useful conclusions about people’s motives. A 
hero with a high  Insight score is often recognised as 
being a sensible and discerning individual, and many 
might seek his counsel.<br/>
A successful  Insight roll provides the hero with a 
faithful, if partial, portrait of the character observed. 
A great or extraordinary success reveals truths about 
an individual of which he himself is ignorant.  Insight 
tests may be rolled in opposition to an adversary using 
Persuade or another Personality skill.
		</div>
		<div name="search" fullname="Search">
		Search is used when trying to find something by close
examination. This skill may let a hero search a library to
locate a piece of relevant information, look for concealed
doors or hidden inscriptions, recognise a familiar face in
a crowd or even search a suspected thief’s clothing. One
roll is required for each inspection of a small area, such
as a room.  Search rolls are generally initiated by the
player rather than the Loremaster; Awareness is used
to see if the characters passively notice something.<br/>
A successful Search roll generally lets the characters find
what they are looking for if it is to be found. A great or
extraordinary success usually means the object is found
more quickly. If an item is particularly well hidden, the
Loremaster could decide that a higher level of success is
required to uncover it.
		</div>
		<div name="explore" fullname="Explore">
		Adventurers rely on their Explore skill when they move 
through an unfamiliar area of the Wild. An Explore test 
may be required during a journey to find the company’s 
heading, or to get back on track after a detour; to 
cope with adverse weather conditions or other natural 
hazards; to create paths through the wilderness suitable 
for others to follow; or to choose a suitable place to 
set up camp. A high  Explore rating is an invaluable 
resource for a companion acting as a scout for his group 
of adventurers.
		</div>
		<div name="healing" fullname="Healing">
		The knowledge of how to relieve pain and apply remedies 
to restore health to the suffering is an ancient one, and 
treatments differ from culture to culture. Almost all 
traditions, however, agree on the treatment of serious 
injuries, which must be immediately tended to keep 
from worsening.<br/> 
The  Healing skill 
includes bone setting 
and the use of herbs 
or salves, but the 
outcome relies on 
the ability of the 
healer to understand 
what ails the sufferer 
and determine what 
should be done.
		</div>
		<div name="hunting" fullname="Hunting">
		Knowing how to hunt is a fundamental skill common in 
much of Middle-earth. A Hunting roll may be required 
when pursuing a creature through wild areas, or to 
locate tracks and follow them, or to identify a quarry by 
its spoor. <br/>
The skill also covers preparing traps and the training and 
use of hunting dogs or birds. In wilder areas, hunters 
learn to apply their trade to more dangerous quarry, 
such as Orcs, Spiders or Wargs, or else risk becoming 
the prey.
		</div>
		<div name="song" fullname="Song">
		Hobbits and Men, Elves and Dwarves, even Goblins and 
maybe Orcs: all the creatures of Middle-earth celebrate 
by playing music and singing songs. Great deeds and 
grim misfortunes are remembered in verse, and pleasant 
or even comic stories are told to ease spirits and find 
comfort. <br/>
Song is used to recite poems, sing songs or play 
instruments suitable to the character’s culture. It can 
also be used to learn new works or create original 
compositions.
		</div>
		<div name="courtesy" fullname="Courtesy">
		The Free Peoples recognise common norms of decency 
and ancient conventions of behaviour. Observing these 
traditions demonstrates respect and is a way of quickly 
establishing a friendly footing even with complete 
strangers. <br/>
A hero succeeding in a Courtesy roll knows what to say 
at the right moment to make a good impression with 
their host, or is mindful of his manners when receiving 
guests. 
		</div>
		<div name="riddle" fullname="Riddle">
		Owing its name to the ancient Game, the Riddle skill 
represents a hero’s ability to draw conclusions from 
seemingly unconnected scraps of information, by 
deduction, reasoning and intuition. <br/>
An adventurer also relies on  Riddle whenever he is 
forced to talk about a subject but wants to conceal part 
of what he knows, for example to explain something 
about himself without revealing his true identity. <br/>
An accepted custom among many creatures, speaking 
in riddles is usually allowed among strangers meeting 
for the first time who want to speak guardedly. This skill 
is also used to gain helpful insight from a spoken or 
written riddle. 
		</div>
		<div name="craft" fullname="Craft">
		The Craft skill doesn’t really cover the whole range of 
abilities of smiths, wrights and other artisans, but reflects 
the talent of a character for making or mending things 
by hand, although Traits like Smithcraft or Woodwright 
can be used to reflect proficiency in a specific craft. 
Craft could be used to attempt to repair the wheel of 
a cart, or construct 
an improvised raft 
with wood found on 
a river shore, or even 
when trying to start a 
fire on a windy hill. <br/>
A high  Craft score 
may indicate that the 
hero was a craftsman 
before starting his life 
of adventure. Some 
races, such as the 
Dwarves and Noldor 
Elves, revere crafts as 
the highest expression 
of creativity.
		</div>
		<div name="battle" fullname="Battle">
		A hero’s proficiency in this skill shows his grasp of the 
rules of battle, and his ability to keep his head when 
involved in a violent confrontation. The Battle skill can 
be used to gain an advantage when involved in a fight 
with a group of foes, or to lead a company of men in 
open battle and maintain order in the midst of chaos 
(combat itself is covered by Weapon skills).
		</div>
		<div name="lore" fullname="Lore">
		Lore expresses a hero’s love for learning, be it a 
fascination with descriptions of distant lands, or an 
interest in family genealogy. Whenever an action involves 
knowledge of some kind, a Lore roll is required. <br/>
Heroes are considered to be knowledgeable in the 
traditions of their own people, and so the Loremaster 
should rarely require a player to make a  Lore test 
for information regarding their character’s culture, 
background or the area they originally come from.
		</div>
		<div name="body" fullname="Body">
		A character with a high Body score can be tough and fit, 
or tall and agile, or even attractive or imposing. Every 
aspect of a character that relies on vigour or physical 
well-being is represented in the game by Body.
		</div>
		<div name="heart" fullname="Heart">
		Measures a character’s capacity for emotion, energy 
and enthusiasm. A hero with a high Heart score can be 
fiery, intense, and hard to demoralise. Activities that 
benefit from a passionate or energetic temper may be 
influenced by a character’s Heart score.
		</div>
		<div name="wits" fullname="Wits">
		A hero with a high Wits rating can be clever, attentive and 
strong-willed. A sharp-witted person is a quick thinker, 
and probably alert and vigilant, so any action that calls 
upon these qualities benefits from a hero’s Wits score.
		</div>
		<div name="barding" fullname="Barding of Dale">
		The Men of Dale are Northmen of noble origins. They 
are often tall and strong-limbed, with fair hair, although 
dark or even black hair is not unknown. Their men 
usually shave their beards completely unless they are 
very old, and cut their hair shorter than the Woodmen 
of Wilderland. Women let their hair grow very long, but 
often braid it in tight tresses. Adventurers from Dale can 
be easily recognised as they carry the best equipment to 
be found among the Men living in Wilderland.
		</div>
		<div name="stoutHearted" fullname="Stout-hearted">
Living for many a year under the ever-present menace 
of Smaug the Dreadful has made the Bardings a 
courageous race. After all, there are not many creatures 
more fearsome than a great Dragon...<br/>
•  When making a test using Valour, Barding characters can roll 
the Feat die twice, and keep the best result.
		</div>
		<div name="bardingBackground1" fullname="By Hammer and Anvil">
		Your parents paid richly for a Dwarf-smith to take you as 
an apprentice in his forge, and you worked hard under 
his severe discipline, to prove that your craft could 
reach his people’s high standards. In the long hours you 
spent hammering on the anvil under the close scrutiny 
of your master, you have learnt that it is possible to 
create amazing things, but it is only by putting your 
heart into your work that you can succeed in creating a 
masterpiece.
 
		</div>
		<div name="bardingBackground2" fullname="Wordweaver">
		King Bard has earned his throne by accomplishing a 
feat deemed unthinkable by most, setting an example to 
generations to come. But it is another deed that caught 
your interest and fired your imagination: that of the witty 
halfling who crossed words with Smaug the Golden in 
his lair. While you yourself do not expect to ever see a 
living Dragon, you look forward to your chance to win 
renown with your cunning. 
		</div>
		<div name="bardingBackground3" fullname="Gifted Senses">
		You grew up in Lake-town, the son of a merchant who 
traded goods with the Raft-elves from the woods. You 
often joined them to row on their crafts, proud of your 
strength as a youth. Under the shadow of the Dragon, 
your family’s business struggled for survival and you 
dared not venture far, but since the death of Smaug, 
you and your brothers have started to journey to the 
Elvenking’s forest stronghold. After many visits to those 
magical halls, your eyes and ears seem to notice details 
that escaped your attention in the past; perhaps a subtle 
gift from the Fair Folk.
		</div>
		<div name="bardingBackground4" fullname="Healing Hands">
		You have long served on a trading boat from Esgaroth, 
first leaving the Long Lake when you were very young. 
Once, staying for months in a distant haven to the 
South, waiting for a caravan from the East to arrive, you 
fell victim to a foreign sickness, and were succoured by a 
lady speaking a strange tongue. She saved your life, and 
taught you how to save others in time of need.
		</div>
		<div name="bardingBackground5" fullname="Dragon-eyed">
		Your great-grandfather witnessed the destruction of his 
father’s house, burnt when the Dragon razed Dale. He 
escaped with his life, but from that day his eyes turned 
the colour of pale ashes. Through your grandfather and 
your father after him, his unrelenting gaze lives on in 
your ashen eyes.
		</div>
		<div name="bardingBackground6" fullname="A Patient Hunter">
		Faithful to your ancestors’ heritage, your family never 
embraced the ways of the Lake-men, and since you were 
a child, you spent long days hunting on the mainland. 
For many years it was a dangerous trade bearing little 
fruit, but now the land is again blooming with every 
new spring, and birds and animals alike are returning 
to claim their old nests and lairs. Now, you will have a 
chance to properly hone your skills once again.
		</div>
		<div name="beorning" fullname="Beorning">
		Beornings are rugged men with brawny arms and legs, 
and lively women with undaunted eyes. Their spirit is 
reflected in their appearance: the women have long, 
wild hair and the men unkempt beards. Born free, they 
pay no tribute nor bow to any crown, keeping at peace 
the strip of land they have chosen as their own. All foes 
of the Beornings are mortal foes, but friends who prove 
to be trustworthy are friends for life. 
		</div>
		<div name="furious" fullname="Furious">
		Beornings fight like cornered animals: when they see their 
own blood they are filled with a red wrath. <br/>
•  During combat, a Wounded Beorning ignores the 
effects of being Weary (whether he was injured during 
the same fight or not).
		</div>
		<div name="beorningBackground1" fullname="Child of Two Folks">
		Many years ago, your father came down from the 
mountains and took as his wife a woman from the tribes 
of Mirkwood. You grew up among two worlds, seen as a 
stranger by both folks. For many years, you encountered 
suspicion and mistrust, and many scoffed at the colour 
of your eyes and hair. But you endured and were finally 
able to take what your heart deemed good from both 
your mother’s and your father’s kin.
		</div>
		<div name="beorningBackground2" fullname="Errand-rider">
		Since the time your family joined Beorn’s folk you have 
been a runner, a messenger carrying news for your folk. 
In your hide shoes, you have countless times trodden the 
path that goes from the High Pass to the Old Ford, always 
welcomed by chieftains and families eager to hear your 
tidings. At times you have brought joy and merriment 
with news of victory, but also woe and distress with tales 
of war and defeat.
		</div>
		<div name="beorningBackground3" fullname="Head of the Family">
		Beorn, the great chieftain of your folk, sent your father to 
watch the mountain passes for the best part of the year, 
leaving you to provide for your family. Whenever the 
pursuit of an animal’s trail led you westward towards 
the mountains, your heart leapt in anticipation of the 
day your father would be back, with new stories to tell 
and fresh scars to testify to their truthfulness.		
		</div>
		<div name="beorningBackground4" fullname="Light-foot">
		They say that when your father was on the look-out, he 
could hide even from the sight of the Great Eagles. From 
him you learnt that there is no dishonour in stealth, 
whether it is your task to spy upon your enemies or 
when you are keeping watch over a village of your folk. 
You have listened to your father’s advice and observed 
his crafty movements, trying to discover and learn his 
tricks.
		</div>
		<div name="beorningBackground5" fullname="Keeper of Tales">
		According to the old men of your folk, when your 
grandfather died he was more than one hundred years 
old. He was a hardy warrior, but you remember him best 
wrapped in his white wolf-skin, recounting tales about 
the bygone days of his youth. He could use words as 
precious as fine diamonds or as loud as clashing iron as 
he spoke of battles won and lost, of kings forgotten and 
buried, and of a threatening Shadow so old its age could 
not be counted in men’s lives. You treasure his tales as 
an invaluable inheritance.
		</div>
		<div name="beorningBackground6" fullname="Voice from the Past">
		The elders and ancient warriors of your tribe spend the 
long evening hours talking in front of the hearth, on the 
stepped dais of the main hall. To the young and restless, 
their soft speaking may seem idle talk, but you loved to 
listen to their wise words as they exchanged tales and 
songs, as old as the intricate images wound around the 
wooden pillars of the hall. One day you might well end 
up adding your own words to the songs of your folk, 
strengthening the bonds of tradition.
		</div>
		<div name="dwarf" fullname="Dwarf of the Lonely Mountain">
		Dwarves are an ancient and secretive race, whose 
customs and traditions are mostly unknown to outsiders. 
At the end of the Third Age, they are a proud but 
dwindling people, survivors from a distant past. Almost 
all Dwarves that can be encountered speak of themselves 
as belonging to ‘Durin’s folk’. They are probably the most 
redoubtable warriors in Middle-earth, hard to break or 
corrupt, but often at odds with other Free Peoples over 
old quarrels or new slights. 
		</div>
		<div name="redoubtable" fullname="Redoubtable">
		The legendary stubborness of Dwarves lets them endure 
burdens that would break the back of the sturdiest of Men.<br/>
•  Dwarf characters calculate their Fatigue threshold by 
adding up the Encumbrance ratings of all the items 
they are carrying, and then subtracting their favoured 
Heart score from the total.
		</div>
		<div name="dwarfBackground1" fullname="A Life of Toil">
		You and your family have laboured hard in the mines 
of the Iron Hills, dreaming that one day you will be able 
to delve deeper once again for far more precious ore. 
Unfortunately, to this day most ancient Dwarf-holds are 
no more than Dragon’s lairs or Orc-infested pits. You toil 
patiently, peering into the gloom with eyes hungry for the 
gleaming of gems and gold. 
		</div>
		<div name="dwarfBackground2" fullname="Far Trader">
		By the reckoning of the Dwarves, you were only a stripling 
when you left your home in the Blue Mountains to follow 
your kinsmen along the trading roads. You have since seen 
many places and met different folks eager to trade goods 
for the product of dwarven handiwork. You remember 
little of the roads you took, as you were led by your more 
experienced kin, but those journeys have awoken in you 
a desire to see the world.
		</div>
		<div name="dwarfBackground3" fullname="Bitter Exile">
		Long ago, your ancestors were driven out of their 
underground halls in the far North. Since you were born, 
you have assisted your ailing father as he suffered from 
his enforced exile. His malady proved infectious, and 
over the long years, your longing for the lost home of 
your forefathers consumed you day after day. You tried 
to quench your spite in forgetfulness, but the embers of 
your anger never died completely. 
		</div>
		<div name="dwarfBackground4" fullname="Eloquent Orator">
		The hardships endured by your folk during two ages of 
the world have inspired many songs. But the words that 
come easier to your lips are those recounting deeds of 
courage and valour or, even better, those exalting the 
craft of your forefathers in works of cunning and skill. 
Your tales are testimony that your people has suffered 
much, but can still see beauty in the Northern World. 
		</div>
		<div name="dwarfBackground5" fullname="A Lesson in Revenge">
		Your grandfather never relented in his hunt for the Orc-
chief from Mount Gundabad who killed his wife. Leading 
you along dim underground passages, he told you much 
about the cruel ways of the servants of the Shadow, and 
how to fight them. His words scared you when you were 
young and haunted your dreams, but now that you have 
started down the road to adventure you begin to see the 
value of his advice. 
		</div>
		<div name="dwarfBackground6" fullname="A Penetrating Gaze">
		Your elder brother instructed you to judge others by their 
deeds, not their words, especially when dealing with the 
fair-spoken Elves. But in time you have come to trust 
your instinct above all else, as your heart is not easily 
swayed. Thieves and liars do not dare to meet your eyes, 
as you seem able to lay bare their plots.
		</div>
		<div name="elf" fullname="Elf of Mirkwood">
		Elusive warriors devoted to the preservation of their 
hidden realm, Silvan Elves are a fair but hardy folk. Their 
experiences have made them suspicious of other peoples, 
but have not robbed them of the ability to delight in the 
simple pleasures of living. Even though their power is 
slowly waning, Elves are staunch fighters dedicated to 
resisting the encroaching darkness, either alone or side-
by-side with trusted allies. As all those who belong to 
the Firstborn, they are not subject to illness or old age, 
and thus can dwell within the circles of the world until 
they choose to leave it, or are slain.
		</div>
		<div name="folkOfTheDusk" fullname="Folk of the Dusk">
		While fond of the Sun, the Elves of Mirkwood find 
themselves at greater ease under moonlight or starlight, 
or among the shadows of a forest; their senses are keener, 
their motions exceedingly sure and graceful.<br/>
•  When an Elf of Mirkwood is inside a forest or under 
the earth, or it is night, all his Attribute bonuses are 
based on his favoured rating in all rolls involving the use of a Common skill. 
		</div>
		<div name="elfBackground1" fullname="New Hope">
		You have lived among the Raft-elves, often dealing with 
the Men of Lake-town on behalf of King Thranduil. At 
first, it was only your sire’s command that made you 
leave your forest home, but now you have no regrets. 
The world beyond the King’s realm is wide and, while 
full of hidden threats, is also populated by other valiant 
peoples, enemies of the same Shadow that your kin has 
fought for centuries. It could well be your mission to find 
worthy and trusted allies to join you in your fight...
		</div>
		<div name="elfBackground2" fullname="A Musical Legacy">
		Your father was a minstrel of great virtue, whose work will 
be praised for countless years. His talent passed along to 
you, but transformed into a love for the music that lies in 
plain speech. Your voice is pleasing to all listeners, and 
you choose your words much as your fingers choose the 
strings on the harp.
		</div>
		<div name="elfBackground3" fullname="Memory of Suffering">
		A long time ago, Elves akin to your folk dwelt around 
the Naked Hill in the south of Greenwood the Great, 
before the Necromancer claimed it to build his fastness 
of sorcery. Now that the Shadow has fled, you have 
often journeyed there to spy upon that dreaded place, 
to ponder on the hurt suffered by your people in many 
years of cruel warfare. Many of your kinsmen prefer to 
forget and be merry, but you know that evil is seldom 
conquered forever.
		</div>
		<div name="elfBackground4" fullname="Noble Blood">
		In your veins runs the blood of Elven adventurers of 
great renown, who in ages past chose to dwell among 
the Silvan Elves, seeking refuge and peace in troubled 
years. They say their superior wisdom is reflected in 
your noble countenance, and much is expected of you in 
the coming wars. You have sworn never to betray these 
expectations, and you will die before you see your fair 
home reduced to ruins.
		</div>
		<div name="elfBackground5" fullname="Wild at Heart">
		The beauty of Greenwood the Great seems lost forever 
in the shadows of Mirkwood, but you still find solace 
running alongside its wild beasts, as your kinsmen did 
for centuries. The wood sings to you as tree branches 
sway and leaves rustle; enchanting music you strive to 
decipher. Some find your ways to be simple and rustic, 
but they fail to see the wisdom of choosing to live your 
life fully in these waning years.
		</div>
		<div name="elfBackground6" fullname="Envoy of the King">
		You have journeyed far from the borders of the Woodland 
Realm with your father, on his errands to the courts of 
Men and Dwarves. Standing by his side, you have learnt 
much in a handful of months; more than in years spent 
in the gilded cage of your home. Sadly, you have also 
discovered how the Shadow is creeping upon the outside 
world, gaining in strength with each passing year.   
		</div>
		<div name="hobbit" fullname="Hobbit of the Shire">
		Hobbits are much smaller than Men, even smaller than 
Dwarves, and are often mistaken for children by Men 
who see them. Such likeness may be explained through 
a long-forgotten common ancestry, which would also 
explain why Hobbits often like or dislike the same things 
as Men do. A merry folk, Hobbits are good-natured 
individuals. When pushed to resort to weapons, they 
choose small swords and short hunting bows, which 
they can shoot with uncanny precision when needs be.
		</div>
		<div name="hobbitSense" fullname="Hobbit-sense">
		Hobbits possess a cheerful spirit and a friendliness that 
makes them good companions. Additionally, they have 
learned their place in the world a long time ago, and 
a deep-rooted sense of proportion has found its place 
in their hearts. No visions or wild fantasies can  tempt 
them, as they do not seek power or control over others. <br/>
•  Each Hobbit character in the group increases 
the company’s Fellowship rating by one point. 
Additionally, when making a Wisdom roll, Hobbits 
can roll the Feat die twice, and keep the best result.

		<div name="hobbitBackground1" fullname="Restless Farmer">
		You were born into a family of farmers in the 
Southfarthing, where the best pipe-weed grows. To 
satisfy your curiosity – and your father’s expectations 
– you started to work at a very early age, learning a lot 
from farmhands and traders. From time to time, you 
feel your closeness to the earth move you, awakening a 
desire to sleep in the fields, under a canopy of stars.  
		</div>
		<div name="hobbitBackground2" fullname="Too Many Paths to Tread">
		Your father was a tradesman and you were supposed 
to take his place in his workshop in Hardbottle at the 
age of 33. But before that time, a mysterious wanderlust 
took you and you were away from home for months. 
When you came back, you renounced your position, to 
the outrage of your whole neighbourhood. But you know 
that secretly your father approves: he always dreamed of 
leaving the Shire to ‘go and see Elves’!
		</div>
		<div name="hobbitBackground3" fullname="A Good Listener">
		Your uncle was a Sheriff, and often brought you along 
with him when he went ‘beating the bounds’, that is, 
when he was appointed to watch the Shire’s borders for 
Outsiders. More often than not, his watch included a 
visit to The Ivy Bush, a small inn on the Bywater Road. 
There, you have heard told the best stories over deep 
mugs of excellent beer.
		</div>
		<div name="hobbitBackground4" fullname="Witty Gentleman">
		You come from a well-to-do family of landed gentry 
of the Westfarthing, living in a Hobbit-hole in Michel 
Delving. It is rumoured that your great-grandfather 
once vanished, only to show up three days later at the 
local inn, talking of a giant Tree-man he had seen on 
the North Moors. Some believe your family’s fortune is 
based on the giant’s hoard your ancestor discovered, but 
you have been able to dispel such rumours with your 
humorous remarks.
		</div>
		<div name="hobbitBackground5" fullname="Bucklander">
		Your parents belong to the folk of Buckland, and you were 
brought up on the ‘wrong side of the Brandywine River’, 
as they say. If half the tales be true, members of your 
family have always displayed a certain queerness of 
character, and an unusual fighting spirit, a strangeness 
you seem to possess yourself. 
		</div>
		<div name="hobbitBackground6" fullname="Tookish Blood">
		You grew up peacefully in a farmhouse in the Marish, 
Eastfarthing, until something Tookish stirred in your 
blood and overcame your respectability. It first happened 
on your way home one night, when you spotted some 
outlandish folk around a bright camp-fire. When you 
described them to your grandmother, she told you they 
were Dwarves, on their way to the Blue Mountains. From 
that night you started to shun well-trodden paths, hoping 
to meet other wayfarers secretly crossing the Shire. 
		</div>
		<div name="woodman" fullname="Woodman of Wilderland">
		As all Men of the North, they are commonly light-haired 
and tall, but often brown-skinned with a little red in their 
cheeks thanks to a life in the open. Sometimes deemed 
surly of speech and unforthcoming by other folk, they 
are rangers and hunters, haters of Orcs and Spiders, 
skilled in fighting in the deep of the woods with bows of 
yew, stout spears, and long-hafted axes. They were once 
skilful tamers of steeds and hunting dogs, but their life 
under the Shadow has forced them to mostly abandon 
the training of horses, and to favour that of hounds. 
		</div>
		<div name="woodcrafty" fullname="Woodcrafty">
		The Woodmen know the woods so well that they can 
put a name on every shade of green found in a forest. 
Wearing the proper raiment and adopting clever ploys 
suggested by the Brown Wizard, they can trick the eyes 
of others and use the many obstacles found in the woods 
to their advantage. <br/>
•  When the Woodmen fight in the woods, they use their 
favoured Wits score as their basic Parry rating.
		</div>
		<div name="woodmanBackground1" fullname="The Hound">
		The dogs bred by the folk of Woodland Hall are dun 
in colour, long of limb, sharp-nosed, gaunt and great. 
Since you were a child, you have always felt drawn to 
their natural grace and ferocious loyalty. But, above all, 
you share their love for the hunt, and you can feel their 
excitement when they are closing in on their prey. 
		</div>
		<div name="woodmanBackground2" fullname="Wizard’s Pupil">
		Many years ago, you and your sisters and brothers used 
to challenge each other to recall the stories depicted in 
the woven tapestries hung along the walls of the great 
hall of Rhosgobel. One day, you caught the attention 
of the wizard Radagast, and he told you how the deeds 
of your ancestors were handed down from generation 
to generation as songs. He taught you that there are 
important lessons to be learnt from the past, and from 
the actions of those that came before you. 
		</div>
		<div name="woodmanBackground3" fullname="Fairy Heritage">
		They say your mother was as fair as an Elf-maiden, and 
that your father spirited her away from the Wood of 
Sorcery far in the South. You don’t know if this is true, 
although you doubt it, as there was nothing sorcerous in 
her true love for you and your father. You remember that 
her senses oftentimes proved to be very sharp, as yours 
promise to be.
		</div>
		<div name="woodmanBackground4" fullname="Apprentice to the Mountain-folk">
		The precious ore that hammer and anvil shape into tools 
and weapons is difficult to come by in the vales of the 
Great River, and commerce has grown thin in the years 
of ever-growing darkness. When you were younger, you 
and many other children of your age were sent by the 
alderman of your clan to join the workers in the mines 
above Mountain Hall. You remember long days as dark 
as winter nights, spent underground searching for the 
glimmer that would put swords into the hands of the 
warriors of your folk, and needed tools for shepherds, 
hunters and farmers alike. 
		</div>
		<div name="woodmanBackground5" fullname="Seeker">
		The wild-wood can scare the hardiest of men, but that 
didn’t stop you and your brothers from climbing every 
tree and running along any path you could find under 
the eaves of the forest. Your father’s rules prevented you 
from straying from the paths connecting Woodland Hall 
to the southern homesteads, but at times you have seen 
glimpses of queer things where the shadows in the woods 
are deeper. Now that you have outgrown your father’s 
authority, your thirst for adventure won’t be easily 
quenched.
		</div>
		<div name="woodmanBackground6" fullname="Sword-day Counsellor">
		When he was a youth, your uncle severely injured his own 
right leg, mishandling his axe. Deprived of his rightful 
place among the active warriors of your folk, he instead 
turned to his wits and experience to contribute to the 
fight against the Shadow. His cunning was instrumental 
in many a victory on the field of battle. He proved to you 
that when war is at hand, good advice is as important as 
good swords to ensure triumph.
		</div>
		<div name="beastLore" fullname="Beast-lore">
		The forests, plains, marshes and mountain ranges of 
Wilderland teem with life. Your knowledge of beasts 
can provide information regarding an animal you are 
hunting, or tell you whether a cave you chose as refuge 
is likely to be the den of a dangerous creature.
		</div>
		<div name="boating" fullname="Boating">
		You know how to handle a boat in the running waters of 
a river, or in the tricky currents of a lake.

picking and, in general, any shadowy way to get hold

almost anything, if needs be.

		You are able to catch fish with net, spear, bow or line, or

your patient craft.
		</div>
		<div name="folkLore" fullname="Folk-lore">
		You possess some knowledge of the many traditional 
customs, beliefs and stories of the various communities 
that compose the Free Peoples. Likely the result of your 
wanderings, this information may help you when dealing 
with strangers, letting you come up with some useful fact 
regarding their folk or a smattering of the appropriate 
language. Wanderers generally pick up this Trait during 
their time on the road. 
		</div>
		<div name="gardener" fullname="Gardener">
		The tending of gardens has awoken in you a love for all 
growing things, and lets you recognise easily those plants 
and fruits that are wholesome and most nourishing.
		</div>
		<div name="herbLore" fullname="Herb-lore">
		Whether used to identify a spice, a plant with curative 
properties or a blend of pipe-weed, herb-lore is a 
knowledge favoured by many races of Middle-earth. 
Among other uses, this Trait may prove helpful when 
cooking, or when preparing a healing salve.

sources, from stories heard around the fire to the dusty 
records of a chronicler.
		</div>
		<div name="rhymesOfLore" fullname="Rhymes of Lore">
		Rhymes of Lore are brief compositions in verse created 
by many cultures to remember significant facts from 
ancient history. Your knowledge of them can supplement 
a test of Lore, but is used especially in conjunction with 
any Custom skill (Courtesy, Song or Riddle). Scholars 
may credit much of their knowledge to rhymes.

metalwork.

		<div name="shadowLore" fullname="Shadow-lore">
		You have recognised that there is a shadowy thread 
unifying most of what is malicious, dark and terrible 
in Middle-earth, and that the thread is thickening year 
after year. A quality shared by the wise of the land, 
the truth behind this knowledge is getting plainer as 
the time passes. Wardens, committed to opposing the 
Shadow at every turn, collect this knowledge wherever 
they can.

Raise your standard of living from Prosperous to Rich; 
from now on, your Standing rating doesn’t decrease 
during a Fellowship phase.  <br/>
If, during play, you receive a wound that would normally 
kill you (a coup de grâce or a killing blow) you can choose 
between the following options: <br/>
1. You die, and let your direct descendant inherit the 
Birthright Virtue as an additional Cultural blessing 
(a free Virtue at character creation), or <br/>
2. You are saved by some miraculous circumstance 
that leaves you wounded but alive. You then reset your 
Standing rating to zero, as you are then presumed 
dead by your own folk. You can do this only once, 
and never again.

		<div name="fierceShot" fullname="Fierce Shot">
		You have learnt to bend your bow so fiercely that you

When you are using a great bow your ranged Damage 
bonus is based on your favoured Body score.
		</div>
		<div name="kingsMen" fullname="King’s Men">
		The former glory of the proud hosts of Dale has been

destruction of the city. As a descendent of one of these 
bloodlines, you share this gift.<br/>
Sometimes, you feel a sense of foreboding that warns 
you of impending catastrophe and other gloomy events. 
But the future is always uncertain, and sometimes what 
you foresee never materialises.<br/>
Raise your maximum Hope score by 1 point. Additionally, 
once every Adventuring phase, you may invoke your 
power of foresight. When this happens, the Loremaster 
should give you a relevant piece of information 
regarding negative events likely to occur during your 
current adventure. If no such information is available 
– or the Loremaster prefers not to divulge it – at the 
start of the next Fellowship phase, he must award you 
one Experience point instead (your foresight contained 
a more intimate message, leading to a sudden bout of 
insight or deeper understanding).
   <br/>
Your foresight manifests in many forms: it can be a hazy 
vision, a recurring and enigmatic dream, or a cryptic 
message borne by a talking bird.
		</div>
		<div name="brothersToBears" fullname="Brothers to Bears">
		Beorn has taught you to heed the call of an ancient 
animal heritage. When the moon is high in the sky and

Raise your maximum Endurance score by 3 points. 
Additionally, from now on your sight and hearing are 
greatly enhanced at night, and let you see or hear better 
than under the light of the sun, and at a greater distance: 
when you make a roll using a Perception skill at night 
you always add your Attribute score to the result, as if 
enjoying an Attribute bonus.

		<div name="nightGoer" fullname="Night-goer">
		At night you can slip into a dream-like state, and leave 
your body in spirit form to swiftly travel along the tracks 
made by animals across the length and breadth of 
Wilderland.<br/>
In this state, you can spend a point of Hope to explore an 
area within three days of travel, until sunrise wakes you. <br/>
Your spirit form takes the appearance of a full-grown 
bear. It is visible to onlookers, and leaves tracks on the 
ground. While you are outside your body, any action 
you attempt is resolved using your Attributes and skills 
as usual, but any strenuous activity causing the loss 
of Endurance wakes you up. Any harm suffered while 
travelling in spirit form is transferred to your body at the 
moment of awakening.

		<div name="skinCoat" fullname="Skin-Coat">
		Tales say that a warrior’s own courage will turn steel 
and iron better than the smith’s hammer-work.<br/>
When you are hit by a Piercing blow in combat, you may 
choose to reduce your Endurance score by a number of 
points before rolling for Protection, to lower the Injury 
rating of the blow by an equal number.

		<div name="greatStrength" fullname="Great Strength">
		As long as you can move freely while fighting, you may 
profit from great strength and nimbleness. <br/>
If the total Encumbrance of your carried gear is equal to

stance, you receive a bonus of +3 to your Parry score.

		<div name="twiceBakedHoneyCakes" fullname="Twice-baked Honey Cakes">
		The honey-cakes of the Beornings are legendary among 
travellers. You can march far by eating just a little of 
them, and they are much more pleasant than cram, 
the waybread that Dale-men make for journeys in the 
wild. You have been shown the secret of baking such 
cakes, and can prepare them for the consumption of all 
members of your Company.<br/>
 
Raise your company’s Fellowship rating by one point. 
Additionally, when you are on a journey, you and your 
fellow travellers reduce the difficulty of all your Fatigue 
tests by a value equal to your Wisdom rating.
		</div>
		<div name="brokenSpells" fullname="Broken Spells">
		You have been taught some long-remembered fragments 
of old spells that retain power to this day.  Some require 
you to cut or engrave a Runic inscription, usually in stone 
or metal, or sometimes carved in wood. You can learn a 
total of three spells: secrecy, prohibition and exclusion, 
and opening and shutting. <br/>
You must choose one spell when you first select this 
Virtue, and you may learn a new one by spending 
one Experience point as your undertaking during a 
Fellowship phase.
<br/>
<b>Spells of Opening and Shutting</b><br/>
This fragment must be recited in front of a door or gate, 
to magically lock it, or recited backwards to open it if 
locked. The spell has no effect on a door that has been 
blocked by magic and now requires a particular word to 
open it, but might work if the entrance was barred by the 
same type of magic.<br/>
The spell starts working as soon as you have finished 
reciting it.<br/>
<b>Spells of Prohibition and Exclusion</b><br/>
This Runic inscription was usually placed on gates and 
on doors, to protect an area from unwanted visitors. 
You may carve these signs on a rock or on the bark of a 
tree within the perimeter of your camp, and their power 
will wake you at the first sign of danger. <br/>
Carve the runes and go to sleep. You will immediately 
awaken if any threatening presence approaches.
<br/>
<b>Spells of Secrecy</b><br/>
Carve these runes on a concealed door, personal hiding 
place or object, and it will be noticed only if someone 
searches for it with great care. These signs are invisible 
to the untrained eye as long as the power within them is 
still working; they can only be seen and read when the 
spell is spent or broken.<br/>
The object concealed by the spell can only be found with 
an extraordinary Search result, unless the searcher is a 
Dwarf (in which case a simple success is enough).
		</div>
		<div name="durinsWay" fullname="Durin’s Way">
		You have been taught how to defend yourself while 
fighting under the surface of the earth. You know how to 
exploit corners, darkness and other natural obstacles to 
your advantage.<br/>
When fighting underground, your Parry rating receives 
a bonus of +3.
		</div>
		<div name="oldHatred" fullname="Old Hatred">
		When you face your kin’s most hated enemies you feel 
the strength of your ancestors, slain by the foul hands of 
Orcs, flowing impetuously in your veins. <br/>
When you are fighting Orcs and their kind using hand-
to-hand weapons, add a bonus of +3, or your Valour 
rating (whichever is higher), to the total Endurance loss 
inflicted by each of your blows.  
		</div>
		<div name="ravensOfTheMountain" fullname="Ravens of the Mountain">
		You have befriended a raven of the ancient breed living 
around the Lonely Mountain. Long-lived and able to 
speak the common tongue, these birds are often wise 
companions, bound to your kin by ties of old friendship. 
Many times in the past they have provided invaluable 
help by gathering news or sending messages for your 
folk.<br/>
If you are in Wilderland, your raven friend is never far 
away. You can sound a call and summon him to your 
presence in a matter of minutes. As soon as he joins you, 
you may command him.<br/>
Usually, the raven is eager to please you, but an 
unusual or less than reasonable request might put their 
faithfulness to the test and require a  Courtesy roll 
against a TN of 14. The raven does not ask for anything 
in return, but repeated requests over a short time might 
sooner or later lead him to feel entitled to compensation 
(his precise terms are up to the Loremaster, and might 
lead to interesting story developments). <br/>
The time needed for a raven to complete the errand 
depends on the request, on the distance to be covered, 
and on the complexity of the assignment. A raven flies 
at an average speed of thirty miles per hour (enough to 
cross the whole width of Mirkwood in one day)<br/>
The following list shows some of the possible errands 
you can assign to your winged ally, but should in no way 
limit your inventiveness. <br/>
<b>Bring tidings</b>: a raven is always well informed about 
the latest events concerning the Wild, and is eager to 
report them. <br/>
<b>Carry messages</b>: the raven can deliver messages 
anywhere in the region, passing its content to others of 
his kin. <br/>
<b>Investigate</b>: the raven can be sent to gather information 
on a specific subject. It must be something naturally 
accessible to one of its kind.<br/>
<b>Carry food</b>: a raven might be persuaded to carry some 
food if able to steal or borrow it from a location within 
a day’s flight.

		<div name="theStiffNeckOfDwarves" fullname="The Stiff Neck of Dwarves">
		Dwarves are deemed to be stubborn and unyielding. 
Their natural inclination to persevere against all odds is 
strengthened by the taint of the Shadow.<br/>
You add a number equal to your current Shadow score 
to all your rolls involving the use of a Common skill (with 
the exception of all Custom skills).
		</div>
		<div name="deadlyArchery" fullname="Deadly Archery">
		Most members of your kin possess a natural talent for 
hitting the mark when using their bows. You seem to 
possess that quality yourself, as your arrows find their 
target with uncanny precision.<br/>
When you spend a point of Hope to invoke an Attribute 
bonus on a ranged attack roll using a bow, you receive 
an additional bonus equal to your basic Heart score.
		</div>
		<div name="elvishDreams" fullname="Elvish Dreams">
		You have learnt to recover from your exertions while 
engaging in a repetitive task, like walking, or rowing in 
a boat. <br/>
At the end of a day of activity, you recover a number of 
Endurance points equal to your Wisdom rank. If you 
then take a prolonged rest, you recover normally.
		</div>
		<div name="shadowBane" fullname="Shadow Bane">
		Your folk have suffered grievous losses during many 
wars against the Shadow. Even the passing of centuries 
cannot quell the bitter hate that your kindred harbour 
for the Enemy. <br/>
When you are fighting in a Forward stance 
against servants of the Shadow (including Spiders, Orcs, 
Trolls and Evil Men), add one Success die to all your attack 
rolls (up to a maximum of 6).  
		</div>
		<div name="theSpeakers" fullname="The Speakers">
		You have learnt how to communicate with almost 
everything, from any living being to grass, stone and 
water. This means, for example, that you can hear from 
the stones in a path who trod it recently, or sing to soothe 
an unquiet animal.<br/>
To use this gift you must make an appropriate skill roll. 
Which skill you use depends on what you are trying to 
do and is at the Loremaster’s discretion, but here are a 
few examples: to interpret the words of the stones in a 
path requires a roll of Riddle; to restrain a scared horse 
requires a roll of Song; to listen to the voice of a river 
requires a roll of Insight.
		</div>
		<div name="woodElfMagic" fullname="Wood-elf Magic">
		You are mastering what mortals might call ‘Elf-magic.’ 
You learn how to fling a Stinging Arrow when you first 
select this Virtue. You may later master the making 
of  Elf-lights as your undertaking, and spending one 
Experience point during a Fellowship phase; finally, 
you discover the secret of Enchanted Sleep by spending 
another Experience point as another undertaking during 
a later Fellowship phase.<br/>
<b>Stinging Arrow</b><br/>
 You can make an arrow flicker as if with a magical fire,
making it fly true.<br/>
Spend a point of Hope when you let loose an arrow and
it will fly up to twice its normal range, OR spend a point
of Hope after a successful ranged attack using a bow or
great bow to produce an automatic Piercing blow. <br/>
<b>Elf-lights</b><br/>
You know how to make a torch or a lamp burn with a 
peculiar flame that attracts all mortals who see it.
Spend a point of Hope to light a torch, or a lamp. Any 
speaking creature who sees its flame must try to get near 
it by any means possible, or spend a point of Hope (or 
Hate) to ignore the spell effect. <br/>
You may snuff out the light at will, even from a distance, 
either to extinguish the flame quickly and quietly, or 
to cause it to flare suddenly to blind and confuse your 
enemies (those standing close to the flare are fight as if 
Weary for one round of combat).<br/>
<b>Enchanted Sleep</b><br/>
Having used an elf-light to attract an unwary victim, you 
can enchant him into slumber. <br/>
You may snuff out the elf-light when someone enters the 
area illuminated by the light. The first living creature 
with an Attribute level lower than 6 that enters the area 
drops immediately in an enchanted sleep.
		</div>
		<div name="artOfDisappearing" fullname="Art of Disappearing">
		You have learnt to choose exactly the right moment 
to turn away from the attention of others, sometimes 
unconsciously anticipating the need to disappear.<br/>
At the start of an episode where the location you are 
in is entered by newcomers, and if the location offers 
even the smallest opportunity to hide or sneak silently 
away, you can spend a point of Hope to disappear. You 
could slip into a convenient shadowy corner, a thick 
patch of undergrowth, a crowded room, a sharp bend 
in a passage underground or any other potentially 
concealing feature – the final decision on whether there 
is available concealment lies with the Loremaster. <br/>
No roll is needed, and you are considered to be present 
in the area, but unseen to the eyes of the interlopers. 
If the newly arrived individuals knew that you were 
present, it is as if you actually disappeared into thin 
air. You can at any moment choose to reveal yourself, 
simply stepping into the open from your hiding place.

		One of the Wise once said that you have to put a Hobbit 
in a tight place before you find out what is in them (the

When you spend a point of Hope to invoke an Attribute 
bonus, you additionally cancel all penalties enforced from 
being Weary for that action.

		When you are allowed to take a prolonged rest in a safe 
place (not ‘on the road’), you recover your health at a 
prodigious pace, whether you are hurt or simply tired.<br/>
If you are Wounded and your injury hasn’t been treated 
you recover 2 Endurance points; if you are Wounded and 
your injury has been treated successfully, you recover 
4 Endurance points; if you are uninjured, you recover 3 
Endurance points plus your favoured Heart rating.<br/>
When you are travelling, you recover normally (the reduced 
recovery rates found on page 11 do not apply to you).

		<div name="smallFolk" fullname="Small Folk">
		You have learnt how to gain an advantage in a fight from 
being smaller than most of your opponents. <br/>
When you are being attacked in close combat by a 
creature bigger than you (very often), your basic Parry 
rating is calculated using your favoured Wits score, 
instead of your basic Wits.<br/>
Outside of combat, you gain the ‘Small’ Trait, and can 
invoke it using the usual Trait rules (see the Traits chapter 
for details).

		Mirkwood is shunned by many men and beasts, yet its 
shadowy eaves are still good for the growing of herbs. 
You are learning the ancient craft of concocting salves 
and herbal remedies from your village elders and wise-
women. <br/>
You learn to recognise which herbs qualify as Fragrant 
Weeds when you first select this Virtue, and can master 
the secrets of  Poison Remedies as your undertaking 
during a Fellowship phase, and  spending one 
Experience point.<br/>
<b>Fragrant Weeds</b><br/>
You have developed the habit of chewing some herbs 
and roots that are said to bring vigour back into a man’s 
limbs. As long as you are in a wild area, you can collect 
enough herbs for their effect to be noticeable:<br/>
When your Endurance rating drops to equal or below 
your Fatigue score for the first time, you are not yet 
considered Weary. You become Weary only when your 
Endurance drops again.<br/>
<b>Poison Remedies</b><br/>
You can find the necessary ingredients to concoct a 
drink that, when ingested, will help a victim shake off 
the effects of spider-poison, or to prepare a salve that 
when applied to a wound or a bruise will neutralise the 
action of Orc-poison.<br/>
Spend a point of Hope and roll Craft against a TN of 
16 to neutralise the effects of a single poison type on all 
members of your Company.

		<div name="houndOfMirkwood" fullname="Hound of Mirkwood">
		Your folk have always delighted in training great, long-
jawed hounds, stronger than wolves. You have chosen 
a wolfhound of Wilderland to accompany you in your 
wanderings and the faithfulness of your hound reinforces 
your spirit. <br/>
Raise your maximum Hope score by 2 points. <br/>
But such trust comes at a price: a Hound of Mirkwood 
is a valorous and noble beast, always ready to take the 
side of his human companion during combat.<br/>
When you are engaged in  battle, if an attack aimed 
at you produces an Eye Of Sauron result, the blow hits and 
automatically wounds the hound instead (in place of 
the effects of a normal hit). You may prevent this by 
taking the automatic wound yourself (you cannot roll for 
Protection). A wounded hound is put out of combat for 
the remainder of the scene, and will return at your side 
at the start of the next session only if you succeed in a 
Healing roll with a TN of 16. If you fail, the hound will 
not recover until the next Fellowship phase.<br/>
The training of a Hound of Mirkwood is an endeavour 
in itself; the teachings of Radagast have turned this 
craft into an art. When you first choose this Virtue, 
your hound learns to assist you with one Common skill 
as described under Support below, without paying the 
Experience point cost. You can train him to  Support 
additional skills, as well as to assist you in combat, as 
a separate undertaking during  later Fellowship phases, 
as follows:<br/>
<b>Support</b><br/>
You can train your hound to assist you in one activity.
A dog can be trained to support you when making
any  one of the following skill rolls: Awe, Awareness, 
Explore, or Hunting. It takes a Fellowship phase and 
one Experience point to teach your dog to complete an 
additional task.<br/>
When you are making a roll using one of the skills 
imparted to your dog, you may roll the Feat die twice, 
and keep the best result.<br/>
<b>Harass Enemy</b><br/>
You may spend a Fellowship phase and two Experience 
points to teach your animal companion to harass your 
opponent when fighting at close quarters.<br/>
When  you are fighting alongside your animal 
companion, your immediate adversary in close combat 
is always considered to be Weary.<br/>
<b>Protect</b><br/>
You may spend a Fellowship phase and one Experience 
point to teach your hound to steadfastly defend you 
when you withdraw to attack your enemies with a 
ranged weapon.<br/>
If you want to fight in a rearward stance, your dog protects 
you, counting as a companion fighting in a close combat 
stance (so that you need only another companion in 
close combat). Additionally, you are allowed to choose 
a rearward stance even if the total number of enemies is 
more than twice the number of companions (up to three 
times) - see Combat at page 156).
 
		</div>
		<div name="naturalWatchfulness" fullname="Natural Watchfulness">
		Whether travelling, exploring or even resting, the 
behaviour of animals can communicate much to those 
who know how to interpret the signs. It could be the 
sudden silence of a bird, or the distant rustling of a beast 
in flight. You have learnt to recognise which sounds and 
sights reveal the approaching of enemies, and to read 
much from your surroundings. <br/>
When you are outside, you may upgrade the quality 
of a successful Awareness roll by one level, turning a 
success into a great success, or a great success into an 
extraordinary one. Additionally, during the day, you 
may make an  Explore roll with a TN of 14 to gather 
information regarding the area surrounding you, as if 
you were observing it from a vantage point (the top of a 
tall tree, a small hill).
		</div>
		<div name="staunchingSong" fullname="Staunching Song">
		This song has been taught to the worthiest members of 
your clan since your people first descended along the 
banks of the Great River. Its tune echoes Elven songs from 
a time of war and weapons, and its precious knowledge 
has been passed with great care from one generation to 
the next. Singing its words over a wound can reduce the 
loss of a warrior’s life-blood to a trickle, letting it flow 
back to the heart.<br/>
At the end of a fight, if you have been Wounded, you 
may roll  Song against TN 14. On a successful roll, 
you recover a number of additional Endurance points 
equal to your Wisdom rating, twice your Wisdom 
rating if the roll was a great success, or three times 
your Wisdom rating if the roll was an extraordinary 
success. Additionally, your injury is considered to have 
been treated successfully (see Chapter Four: Life and 
Death). You may spend a point of Hope to do the same 
for another member of your Company.

		A skilled craftsman has made this piece of equipment 
lighter or less cumbersome than its lesser counterparts, 
thus reducing its Encumbrance. <br/>
The Encumbrance rating of the selected item is reduced 
by 2 (to a minimum of zero Encumbrance).<br/>
This upgrade may be applied to any defensive item, and

helm, and can be selected multiple times (always up to a 
maximum of three Qualities per item).
		</div>
		<div name="reinforced" fullname="Reinforced">
		(shield, unique)<br/>
The shield’s structure is reinforced, possibly with a metal 
rim or a larger iron boss, letting its wearer parry blows 
with greater ease.<br/>
The shield’s Parry bonus is raised by one. In addition, 
the shield cannot be smashed.<br/>
This upgrade may be applied only once, to any type of 
shield (buckler, shield or great shield).
		</div>
		<div name="grievous" fullname="Grievous">
		(weapon, unique)<br/>
The weapon is strong and heavy, inflicting more harm 
on its targets.<br/>
The weapon’s Damage rating is raised by two (a weapon 
that can be wielded with one or two hands gets the bonus 
to both its damage ratings).<br/>
This upgrade may be applied only once, to any one 
weapon.
		</div>
		<div name="keen" fullname="Keen">
		(weapon, unique)<br/>
Sharp and well-balanced, this weapon is more likely to 
produce a piercing blow when hitting its target.<br/>
The weapon’s Edge rating is reduced by one (note that an 
Edge rating of Rune of Gandalf becomes a rating of 10).<br/>
This upgrade may be applied only once, to any one 
weapon type.

Hard and straight, a piercing blow from a fell weapon is

This upgrade may be applied only once, to any one 
weapon type.

The bowyers of Dale used prodigiously tall and powerful 
staves of fine yew wood to make bows for their King’s

When you get a Rune of Gandalf on the Feat die using a Dalish longbow, 
the target must roll the Feat die twice and choose the 
worst result for his Protection test roll.

The Dwarves of the Mountain forged these spears for 
a king who lived before the Dragon came. Their thrice-
forged heads never lose their keenness, and their shafts 
are inlaid with gold.<br/>
When you make a ranged attack using a Spear of King 
Bladorthin, you roll the Feat die twice and choose the 
best result.
		</div>
		<div name="towerShield" fullname="Tower Shield">

The soldiers of Girion, Lord of Dale, carried great shields 
that were so tall that it was said that a grown man could

When you are using a Tower shield, your Parry bonus 
gets an additional +3 against ranged weapons.
		</div>
		<div name="giantSlayingSpear" fullname="Giant-slaying Spear">
		(great spear)<br/>
A giant-slaying spear is an unusually long great spear 
made of ash wood, once used only from horseback.<br/>
When you attack creatures greater than human-sized, the 
Damage rating of the Giant-slaying Spear is raised by +4.

Craftsmen of old have long laboured on these coats of 
leather, shaping and decorating them with lacquers and

your Valour and Wisdom scores enjoy a bonus of +3 as 
far as calculating Tolerance is concerned.
		</div>
		<div name="splittingAxe" fullname="Splitting Axe">
		(axe or great axe)<br/>
A Beorning splitting axe has a wedge-shaped head, 
capable of rending armour with its strokes, a hold-over 
from a time when a Northman needed a weapon capable 
of piercing the skin of a Dragon.<br/>
When you get a Rune of Gandalf on the Feat die using a Splitting axe, 
the target rolls one Success die less on his Protection 
test.
		</div>
		<div name="axeOfAzanulbizar" fullname="Axe of the Azanulbizar">

It is said that every Dwarf that survived the Battle of 
Azanulbizar returned from that battlefield bowed under 
a heavy burden, as he carried the weapons of those 
who died that day and whose bodies were burned in the 
pyre. <br/>
When you are attacking an enemy with an Attribute level 
of 7 or less, if you get a Rune of Gandalf on the Feat die using this axe, 
your opponent is made Weary for the remainder of the 
combat.

The Dwarves of the Mountain make good coats of steel 
rings, but they cannot match the work of the armourers

When you invoke an Attribute bonus on a Protection 
test, use your favoured Body rating as a bonus.

		<div name="helmOfAwe" fullname="Helm of Awe">
		(helm) <br/>
The Dwarven heroes of old wore helms with visors 
crafted by the hammer of the smith in hideous shapes, 
to better dismay the enemy that looked upon them. <br/>
When making a roll using  Awe, you roll the Feat die 
twice and keep the best result.

		<div name="bitterSpear" fullname="Bitter Spear">
		(spear)<br/>
These spears were made with ash wood from what is 
now called Dol Guldur, once home to many woodland

If you get a Rune of Gandalf on the Feat die when attacking with a Bitter 
Spear, you get a +4 to your Injury rating.
		</div>
		<div name="spearmansShield" fullname="Spearman’s Shield">

The agile Elven warriors learnt long ago to profit from 
the protection of a small shield when using a great spear. 
These leaf-shaped bucklers are smaller than most.<br/>
Apply the Parry bonus of this buckler even if you are 
using a two-handed weapon in close combat.
		</div>
		<div name="woodlandBow" fullname="Woodland Bow">
		(bow)<br/>
The Silvan Elves have always eschewed the great bows 
favoured by many folks in the North. They prefer shorter 
and lighter bows that can be bent as quickly as possible, 
as in a forest the enemy can be anywhere.<br/>
You are always allowed to make one additional opening 
volley, even when no opening volleys are allowed (unless 
you are surprised).

One of the oldest stories told in the Shire remembers 
how a company of the best archers that the Shire could 
muster went north to aid the King in battle. They never 
returned, but a number of very strong bows are said to 
have been recovered from the battlefield and preserved 
to this day.<br/>
When making a ranged attack using a Bow of the North 
Downs, add to your rolls a bonus of +3, or your Valour 
rating (whichever is higher).
		</div>
		<div name="kingsBlade" fullname="King’s Blade">
		(short sword)<br/>
At times, country Hobbits find ancient swords inside 
fallen mounds, amid tilled fields or washed ashore 
along a watercourse. Unable to discover their precise 
origin, they call them simply ‘King’s blades.’<br/>
If you roll a great or extraordinary success on an 
attack using a King’s blade, spend 1 point of Hope to 
automatically inflict a Piercing blow.

		Suits of armour are very prized ornaments in the houses 
of the greater families of the Shire. The best among them

If hit by a Piercing blow while wearing Lucky Armour, 
roll the Feat die twice and keep the best result on the 
Protection test.
		</div>
		<div name="beardedAxe" fullname="Bearded Axe">
		(long-hafted axe)<br/>
The most prized axes have a wide ‘bearded’ head, often 
scored with ancient runes of victory. The longer blade 
bites into enemies’ shields, and its hooked end can be 
used to disarm them.<br/>
If you roll a great or extraordinary success on an attack 
using a Bearded Axe, you may choose not to apply your 
Damage rating to smash your opponent’s shield OR disarm 
him instead.
		</div>
		<div name="featheredArmour" fullname="Feathered Armour">

Radagast has blessed these suits of armour with his 
cunning, and now they don’t seem to make a sound

When making a roll using  Stealth wearing Feathered 
Armour, roll the Feat die twice and keep the best result.

When a bow of any type is deemed very powerful, the 
Woodmen of Wilderland call it a ‘shepherds-bow,’ as 
they would use it to protect their herds and cattle from 
the preying claws of the Eagles of the Misty Mountains.<br/>
If you roll a great or extraordinary success on an attack
using a Shepherds-bow, you inflict extra damage equal to 
your basic Heart rating.

		<div name="scholar" fullname="Scholar">
		For you, knowledge makes the wild world a less 
threatening place to live in. Strangers become friends if 
addressed properly, yellowed maps in lost books replace 
a fear of the unknown with curiosity and wonder of 
places you have yet to explore, songs composed in ages 
past strengthen the weariest of hearts. A love of learning 
guides your every step, and illuminates the way for you 
and those who listen to your advice.
		</div>
		<div name="slayer" fullname="Slayer">
		You or your family have suffered a terrible loss at 
another’s hands. You have become an adventurer to 
take your revenge on whoever wronged you, or maybe 
just to leave behind a life that you are not able to enjoy 
any more. Yours is a difficult path to tread, as what you 
have been through makes it hard to give your trust to 
anybody. 
		</div>
		<div name="treasureHunter" fullname="Treasure-Hunter">
		This world has seen the passing of the glory of many 
Dwarven kings and Elven lords, and their heritage is now 
buried in deep dungeons and dim caverns. Pale gold and 
bright jewels beckon all who dare to find them. Be it a 
family treasure stolen by raiding Goblins, or the golden 
hoard of a Dragon, you seek what is lost, even when 
this means you will have to brave unspeakable dangers.
		</div>
		<div name="wanderer" fullname="Wanderer">
		You see the wonders of living in Middle-earth even 
where the Shadow is deepest. Every corner of the land 
holds a promise of untold secrets, and this is why you 
have decided that any dell, cave and river vale can be 
your home, albeit briefly. For when the morning comes, 
another horizon will show your new destination. 
		</div>
		<div name="warden" fullname="Warden">
		In this age of the world where shadows grow deeper with 
every passing year, you have sworn to defend all who 
cannot defend themselves. Often, your choice forces you 
to forsake civilised areas, to better guard their inhabitants 
from what lurks right outside their fences. This has 
made you a stranger to the eyes of the common folk, a 
threatening figure like those you are protecting them from. 
		</div>
		<div name="lureOfSecrets" fullname="Lure of Secrets">
		Inquisitiveness and curiosity are desirable virtues in an
individual, but knowledge can be put to malicious use
and learned individuals can look down on others as
ignorant fools. Secrets are dangerous, as the very desire
of uncovering them may corrupt the heart.
		</div>
		<div name="wanderingMadness" fullname="Wandering-madness">
		Wandering without ever really settling down might be 
the destiny of most adventurers, but it carries the risk of 
never finding something to live for. The road goes ever 
on and on, it’s true, but whither then?
		</div>
		<div name="dragonSickness" fullname="Dragon-sickness">
		Adventurers who find themselves on the road to seek 
lost riches run the risk of catching the age-old disease 
capable of turning a pile of enchanted gold into bitter 
ashes. As the shadow tightens its grip on their hearts, the 
world shrinks around them and their closely-guarded 
possessions. 
		</div>
		<div name="curseOfVengeance" fullname="Curse of Vengeance">
		Individuals who live by the sword are ever tempted to 
draw it, either literally or figuratively, when their will is 
thwarted or when they deem their honour to have been 
impugned by an insult. As corruption spreads in the 
hero’s spirit, his behaviour worsens, leading to more 
extreme violent reactions.  
		</div>
		<div name="lureOfPower" fullname="Lure of Power">
		When a man is given a position of authority, either by 
rank, lineage or stature, he may end up mistaking his 
own wishes for those of the people he should be guiding 
or keeping safe. Power is the quintessential temptation, 
and provides the Shadow with an easy way to win the 
hearts of those who desire it.
		</div>
		<div name="poor" fullname="Poor">
		Impoverished people are probably suffering from a 
bad harvest season, a fell winter, or the aftermath of a 
disease or war. They struggle every day to find what they 
need to survive, and have no time or resources to look 
for anything beyond the bare necessities, let alone equip 
themselves for adventure. <br />
		</div>
		<div name="frugal" fullname="Frugal">
		Frugal folk usually sleep in comfortable common halls 
(or tents, if nomadic) and eat the produce of their own 
lands and pastures. They wear simple clothes at most 
times, although they may possess finer garments for 
special gatherings like season festivals, marriages or 
funerals. Jewels and other superior ornaments, if any are 
in the keeping of members of the society, are treasured 
as possessions belonging to the community, and are 
passed down through generations of appointed keepers. <br />
Adventurers coming from a Frugal folk do not usually 
carry anything of unusual worth (unless as part of their 
war gear), with the possible exception of one or two 
pieces of expensive clothing or common jewellery, like 
a rich mantle or a golden necklace or bracelet; probably 
a token of their status among their peers. Consequently, 
Frugal adventurers can rarely afford to pay for anything, 
and prefer to find or make what they need instead.
		</div>
		<div name="martial" fullname="Martial">
		Individuals belonging to a Martial culture often live 
according to their status in the military hierarchy, 
with simple warriors and soldiers sleeping together 
in a common area; probably as part of the household 
of a renowned chieftain or noble. Meals are usually 
consumed in large halls, with seats and tables arranged 
to observe rules of precedence or respect. Clothing 
reflects the military status of an individual as well, or 
that of his family.<br />
Martial player-heroes have enough resources to look 
after themselves, and to pay for such things as simple 
accommodation and meals. Ever mindful of the cost of 
any luxury, they often lead an austere life, or resort to 
haggling to lower the price of whatever they are trying 
to get hold of.
		</div>
		<div name="prosperous" fullname="Prosperous">
		Almost all families belonging to a Prosperous culture 
can afford to live in separate, private houses. Important 
individuals wear fine clothing and often have one or 
more servants in their service at home.<br/>
		Characters coming from a Prosperous culture can 
usually pay for their share of any out of pocket expense 
encountered along their journey, and might even pay 
for another companion, if need be. This includes, for 
example, paying for comfortable accommodation, 
spending some time drinking in company at an inn, and 
hiring beasts of burden (such as ponies). 
		</div>
		<div name="rich" fullname="Rich">
		Members of a Rich culture live amidst all sorts of 
luxuries, reaping the fruits of flourishing trade or vast 
treasure. Although those less well-off warn that affluence 
can easily lead to spiritual or even physical weakness, 
the availability of material wealth may instead set an 
individual free to focus on more lofty matters, like the 
perfection of a trade or art.<br />
Rich adventurers fare better than their Prosperous 
fellows, but not excessively so. Their life on the move 
does not let them take full advantage of their resources, 
as a good proportion of their wealth will be made up of 
land and riches.

				<i><b class="uiText">uiWSDamage</b>: 3 <b class="uiText">uiWSEdge</b>: G <b class="uiText">uiWSInjury</b>: 12 <b class="uiText">uiEnc</b>: 0</i><br/>
One-handed blades have a range of uses, from skinning 
animals to settling disputes among brutes. Daggers and 
knives are very common, and in the wild areas of the 
land, no man, woman or child is found without one in 
their belt.

A straight-bladed, two-edged sword, wielded in one

sword.

<i>A Long sword can be used with 
one or two hands. The Damage 
and Injury entries list two separate 
ratings.</i><br/>
Only superior craftsmen can produce longer blades. 
These wonderful Elven and Dwarven weapons, and the 
keen blades forged from strange metals by the Men of 
the West, are often known as long swords. A long sword 
may either be wielded with one hand, or used to hack 
and sweep with two hands.

<i>Two-handed weapon.

cannot be used as a ranged weapon and must be wielded 
with two hands.

A simple fighting variation on the common woodcutting
tool, axes hang from the belt of many adventurers raised
in or near forests.

						<i><b class="uiText">uiWSDamage</b>: 9 <b class="uiText">uiWSEdge</b>: G <b class="uiText">uiWSInjury</b>: 20 <b class="uiText">uiEnc</b>: 4</i><br/>
<i>Two-handed weapon.</i><br/>
		Sometimes double-headed, the great axe is an impressive 
heavy weapon that can only be wielded with two 
hands.
		</div>
		<div name="longHaftedAxe" fullname="Long-hafted axe">

<i>A Long-hafted axe can be used 
with one or  two hands. The 
Damage and Injury entries list two 
separate ratings.</i><br/>
Borne with one or two hands, a long-hafted axe is designed 
to hack through the toughest of armour. It is difficult to 
manoeuvre but when mastered it is a fearful weapon, 
as a skilled fighter learns to fight with the long haft of 
the axe and its reinforced tip in addition to the blade.
		</div>
		<div name="bow" fullname="Bow">

<i>Ranged weapon.</i><br/>
		The simple bow is not very different from a hunting-bow. 
It never measures more than five feet in length, so as 
to be strung the more quickly. Elves from Mirkwood use 
bows, as they do not need the superior range of a great 
bow while fighting under the eaves of their forest.
		</div>
		<div name="greatBow" fullname="Great bow">

<i>Ranged weapon.</i><br/>
		As tall as a man and offering superior potency, a great
bow can only be used by warriors with the height and
stature to bend it fully. An arrow from a great bow can
pierce the toughest of armour.
		</div>
		<div name="mattock" fullname="Mattock">

<i>Two-handed weapon.</i><br/>
		A heavy digging implement sporting a curved head with 
a point on one side and a  spade-like ‘blade’ on the 
other, it was used to fearsome effect by the Dwarves who 
followed Dáin Ironfoot during the Battle of Five Armies.
		</div>
		<div name="buckler" fullname="Buckler">
					<i><b class="uiText">uiParry</b>: +1 <b class="uiText">uiEnc</b>: 1</i><br/>
Circular and made of wood reinforced by a protruding 
metal boss, bucklers are usually smaller and lighter 
than regular shields.
		</div>
		<div name="shield" fullname="Shield">
							<i><b class="uiText">uiParry</b>: +2 <b class="uiText">uiEnc</b>: 3</i><br/>
Round, oval or kite-shaped, shields are made of several 
layers of wood, often reinforced by a large central iron 
boss, usually decorated and engraved. A regular shield 
offers good protection from arrows, and is very effective 
at close quarters. 
		</div>
		<div name="greatShield" fullname="Great shield">
							<i><b class="uiText">uiParry</b>: +3 <b class="uiText">uiEnc</b>: 5</i><br/>
Huge and round or barrel-shaped, these shields are 
carried in battle by the sturdiest of warriors, and are 
used to carry back their bodies should they fall, but are 
considered too cumbersome and unwieldy by some.

		The simplest suit of armour available, leather armour 
is made of layers of cured and hardened animal hide 
sewn together. It is ideal for hunting or travelling as it is 
lightweight and comfortable, especially compared with 
mail armour. Leather armour may be crafted as a shirt, 
or a close-fitting corslet with long sleeves, extending its 
protection to the wearer’s hips.
		</div>
		<div name="mailArmour" fullname="Mail armour">
		The most effective type of armour encountered in Middle-
earth at the end of the Third Age is mail armour: suits of
close-fitting rings of metal, created to protect from cutting
and thrusting weapons. From the shining hauberks of
Elven lords to the black mail of Orc-chieftains, mail
armour appears in widely different qualities. Ancient 
mail-coats of dwarf-make, when found, are matchless 
and prized possessions. <br/>
A mail shirt is a chain garment protecting the back, chest 
and abdomen of its wearer, while a coat of mail is a shirt 
with long sleeves. A mail hauberk is a longer coat with 
skirts of mail covering the knees of the wearer, making it 
ideal for those riding into battle.

			You can use this Dice Roller for playing online. If you open the chat window, rolls you make will appear there for others to see.<br/>
			The Dice Roller has seven buttons representing the different amounts of dice you can roll in the game:
			<ul>
				<li>
					If you want to roll only the Feat die, click on the Feat button.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you want to roll the Feat die plus three Success dice, click on the button labeled 3.
				</li>
				<li>
					You can type a number in the text box for making rolls with a given modifier. For example, for rolling the Feat die and 2 Success dice with a modifier of +3
					type a 3 in the text box, then click on the button labeled 2. All rolls made until you empty the text box will have that +3 modifier.
				</li>
				<li>
					You can make a roll like if the character is Weary. For that, put a checkmark on the Weary checkbox. Success dice with values 1, 2 or 3 will show 0 instead.
				</li>
				<li>
					You can roll the Feat die twice and keep the best or worst result. For that, check one of the two corresponding checkboxes. Rolls made will have the Feat die rolled
					twice and discarded one of the results.
				</li>
			</ul>
			You don't need to use the dice roller for creating characters.

		<div name="uiTutOnlineWelcome" fullname="Welcome to the Online Server">
			Welcome to the <b>Online Character Server</b>.<br />
			Here you can create groups of characters to share with your friends and with other people. 
			The character data is stored on the server for free.<br />
			You can use these features to host an online game. With the chat you will be able to share dice rolls.<br/>
			When you save a character in the server, you and your friends will be able to open its character sheet and update it on the run.
		</div>
		<div name="uiTutOnlineGroup" fullname="Character Group">
			The first thing you will need to have to be able to use the full potential of the Online Server is to create your own Character Group.<br/>
			If you don't have one (and if this is your first time here you will likely have none) you will have to create one.<br/>
			When you create a Character Group you must choose a Public Group Name (that will be shown to everyone), and a private login and password<br/>
			<br/>
			Click on Next to go on...
		</div>
		<div name="uiTutOnlineGroup2" fullname="Character Group">
			Click on this button. You will be asked, in this order, for a Public Group Name. Type something like "Trotter's TOR Campaign".<br/>
			Then you will be asked for a login username. Type something secret but easy to retype and remember, like "trot92" without the quotes.<br/>
			Then you will be prompted for a password. Type something secret but easy to retype and remember, like "snarling honey elephant" without the quotes.<br/>			
			Don't choose a login username or a password that are easy to guess from the Public Group Name. If other people guess your credentials, your characters could be vandalized!<br/>			
			<br/>
			Click on that button and provide the information required, then click on Next to go on...<br/>
			If you have a group already, then skip this step by clicking on Next to go on...<br/>
		</div>
		<div name="uiTutOnlineGroup3" fullname="Character Group Credentials">
			If everything went well, you have created your own Character Group in the server. If an error happened it could be that you provided invalid username or password or they have been taken already before.<br/>
			Now type your username and password in these cells. As long as you have your username and password in these cells, you will be interacting with your Character Group.<br/>
			The page will remember the credentials you type here everytime you come back using this same browser in this computer.<br/>			
			If you have several character groups and you want to switch between them, just change the credentials in these cells. You don't need to click anywhere else to log in or anything.<br/>			
			<br/>
			Type your credentials on these cells, then click on Next to go on...			
		</div>
		<div name="uiTutOnlineGroup4" fullname="Public Characters">
			As players store characters into the server, other players can see them too (but not modify them, of course). This could be useful as a repository of ready-made characters for fast games.<br/>
			Click on this button to get a list of all characters that have been stored into the server. It will list their names, culture, calling and the character group they belong to.<br/>
			If you want to open the character sheet of any of them, click on the Load button next to them. The character sheet will be filled with their stats.<br/>			
			<br/>
			Click the button, then load any character, then click on Next to go on...			
		</div>

		<div name="uiTutOnlineGroup5" fullname="Saving Characters">
			When you create a character with the Character Creator you can save it into your Character Group.<br/>
			You can also load a public character and save a copy of it into your Character Group.<br/>
			The most important part is that you can't have more than one character with the same name in your Group. If you attempt to save a second character with the same name as one in your Group, the second character will replace the first one.<br/>
			If you want to modify a character and save the changes back into the server, just leave the same name and the new version of the character will replace the old one.<br/>			
			<br/>
			Click on Next to go on...			
		</div>

		<div name="uiTutOnlineGroup6" fullname="Saving Characters">
			Let's try it out!<br/>
			Load a random character from the public list of all characters!<br/>
			<br/>
			Click on a Load button, then click on Next to go on...			
		</div>

		<div name="uiTutOnlineGroup7" fullname="Saving Characters">
			Now move the Online Server window to a side if needed so that you can see the Name field in the character sheet.<br/>
			Modify that name to something different. For example, rename that character to Aragorn.<br/>
			If you want, change also some other things in the character sheet. Like some skill ranks or attribute values.<br/>
			<br/>
			Rename the character, then click on Next to go on...			
		</div>

		<div name="uiTutOnlineGroup7_1" fullname="Saving Characters">
			Now go back to the Online Server window and click on the Save button.<br/>
			The character will be saved into your Group with the name you chose.<br/>
			<br/>
			Click on the Save button, then click on Next to go on...			
		</div>

		<div name="uiTutOnlineGroup8" fullname="Saving Characters">
			When you save a character, the character list changes to display the list of characters on your Group. You can always get this list by clicking on this button.<br/>
			Now you know how to copy, modify and save a character into your group. Next we will learn how to delete it.<br/>
			<br/>
			Click on Next to go on...			
		</div>

		<div name="uiTutOnlineGroup9" fullname="Deleting Characters">
			To delete a character just click on the Delete button next to it. It will ask for confirmation.<br/>
			Once a character is deleted there is no way back. Poof. It's gone forever. Be careful.<br/>
			Let's delete the character you just saved. Click on his delete button.<br/>
			<br/>
			Click on the Delete button of the character, then confirm, then click on Next to go on...			
		</div>

		<div name="uiTutOnlineGroup10" fullname="Chat">
			The chat is very simple to use, but it makes sense only if more than one person is going to use it, of course.<br/>
			For this tutorial, you can open another browser tab or window that will act as an imaginary friend if you want to try it out.<br/>
			The chat will only work when two or more people have entered the Group credentials and they open the chat window by clicking on this button.<br/>
			<br/>
			Click on the button, then click on Next to go on...			
		</div>

		<div name="uiTutOnlineGroup11" fullname="Chat">
			First and foremost, select an alias for you. Just type your name here.<br/>		
			<br/>
			Type your name in this text box, then click on Next to go on...			
		</div>
		
		<div name="uiTutOnlineGroup12" fullname="Chat">
			Then you can type messages in this box here. If you have a friend doing the same (or yourself in another browser tab or window) you will see their message appear.<br/>		
			<br/>
			Type something and press Enter to send it, then click on Next to go on...			
		</div>

		<div name="uiTutOnlineGroup13" fullname="Dice Rolls in the Chat">
			The chat is not great compared to other chat services. What it is most useful for is for rolling dice during an online game.<br/>		
			Find the Dice Roller panel (it may be below the Online Server window, the Chat window or this tutorial window, move them away) and make a roll.<br/>		
			The roll will be sent to other people in your group connected to the chat.<br/>		
			<br/>
			Roll some dice, then click on Next to go on...			
		</div>

		<div name="uiTutOnlineGroup13_2" fullname="Chat Close">
			Use this button to close the chat window.<br/>		
			<br/>
			Click the Close button, then click on Next to go on...			
		</div>

		<div name="uiTutOnlineGroup14" fullname="Chat Log">
			This button is used to recover all the chat message you have had in the past, in case you want to remember what happened.<br/>					
			<br/>
			Click on Next to go on...			
		</div>

		<div name="uiTutOnlineGroup15" fullname="Chat Log">
			This button is used for the same, but instead of opening the chat window to show the chat history, it will offer it in a file for download.<br/>					
			<br/>
			Click on Next to go on...
		</div>

		<div name="uiTutOnlineGroup16" fullname="Thanks">
			This ends the Online Server tutorial. <br/>	
			I hope you enjoy this feature and please report bugs and provide suggestions to the forums stated in the <b>About...</b> window. :)			
		</div>

		<div name="lakeman" fullname="Man of the Lake">
			The Men of the lake distinguish themselves from their neighbours, the inhabitants of Dale, by their greater love for 'modern' things and exotic novelties,
			a contrast with the Bardings' healthier respect for tradition.
			Where the wealthiest among the men and women of dale display their status 
			wearing gold bracelets and torques, or pins and brooches with precious stones,
			the inhabitants of Lake-town favour rich furs
			and fine-woven fabrics, often the product of foreign craftmanship. Their differences
			extend beyond mere appearance though: Bardings are said to prize nobility and lineage, while Lake-men
			value above all men or women who elevate themselves through resourcefulness and daring.			
		</div>
		
		<div name="tenacious" fullname="Tenacious">
			The Men of Esgaroth are quick to find and exploit the positive 
			in everything they experience, however little it seems. Every defeat is a chance to learn, every blow suffered is a lesson taken by heart.
			<br />
			• When a Man of the lake is wounded, or fails at a roll with seriously negative consequences, he may spend a point of Hope to earn an Experience point. 
			Eligible rolls are, for example, all Fear tests made during combat, all Corruption tests, or any failed roll deemed suitable by the Loremaster.
		</div>
		
		<div name="lakemanBackground1" fullname="Legends spring to life">
			Your old nanny taught you many songs about the Dwarf-kings of the Mountain, and you grew up thinking that their halls of stone were as real 
			as the bone-littered cave of the Mash-ogre she told you about when you misbehaved. Now you know that dreams and legends are real, 
			and that there are treasures and wonderful new lands out there, waiting for you to go and seek them out.
		</div>
		
		<div name="lakemanBackground2" fullname="Restless pupil">
			Your father spent much of his hard-earned gold on your education, to make sure that one day his rigtful heir could aspire to the loftiest positions in the city council.
			But you seemed able to focus only on miths and legends, your single-mindedness finally proving too much for your teachers and your father's patience. Soon you will have to make a choice:
			to renounce your dreams or take the road as an adventurer, to be soon forsaken by your family in favour of your younger siblings - unless you return as a hero.
		</div>
		<div name="lakemanBackground3" fullname="Masterful fingers">
			Everyone who knows you has, at least once, seen you sitting for long hours at your hearth or on the steps of the market-square quays with your knife in hand, whittling
			pieces of wood into animals, blossoms and leaves. Your ability has even drawn comments from passing raft-elves, their praise music to your ears: you feel a measure of kinship
			with those graceful and silent forest-dwelling people, and you will one day go and visit their halls with many pillars, to see with your eyes the fabled carven throne of the Elvenking.
			
		</div>
		<div name="lakemanBackground4" fullname="Lordling">
			You are born into a family of envoys and diplomats, serving the city council of Esgaroth and its Master for countless generations. 
			Your manners are so naturally dignified that you could have passed for the heir of a noble house - if you weren't born in a town where 
			the only lords are merchant princes. But you don't see that as a flaw; where you are planning to go, the actions of an individual are not lessened 
			in worth by lack of a proper lineage. 
		</div>
		<div name="lakemanBackground5" fullname="Watchmen">
			You, your father and his father before him served in the city watch, until the town was incinerated by the fiery death throes of the Dragon. 
			When you saw the great beast fall from the sky, you realised how countless years looking at the distant Mountain had been spent in vain - 
			for of what use is a watchman when his warning is not heeded by heroes who can do something about the coming threat? 
		</div>
		<div name="lakemanBackground6" fullname="Innocence lost">
			When you were a kid you could be seen running starry-eyed along the busy streets of the city, 
			pulling pranks with your friends on noble emissaries, rich merchants, shady traders, even silent sell-swords and menacing cutthroats.
			Your stare lost its innocence when one night your older brother disappeared after a night of drunken revelry. 
			You don't know what happened to him - he may have fallen into the water, but you know well that in Lake-town even drunk men know not 
			to walk close to the edge of the quays... 
		</div>
		
		<div name="minstrelsy" fullname="Minstrelsy">
			You have been trained in the arts of singing and playing one or more musical instruments, 
			according to the tradition of the wandering minstrels. Your musical lore runs deeper than most, 
			as you partake of the knowledge of musicians coming from foreign lands.
		</div>
		
		<div name="bowmanOfTheGuild" fullname="Bowman of the Guild">
			You have demonstrated a talent worthy of admission to the Bowmen's Guild of Esgaroth, 
			a honourable association uniting the best archers of Lake-town. Now you may train and 
			share secrets of the trade with many old friends of Bard the Bowman himself, all veterans of the Battle of Five Armies. 
			<br/>
			• Raise your Standing by 1 point. Additionally, from now on, when you are using a bow or a great bow, 
			you may spend a point of Hope to upgrade the quality of a successful attack roll by one level, 
			turning a success into a great success, or a great success into an extraordinary one. 
		</div>
		<div name="merchantPrince" fullname="Merchant Prince">
			Your family's fortune is rising with the reopening of the trading routes that lead to the markets in the South and East.
			This increased affluence has started to positively affect your adventuring life, as you may choose a servant from those employed 
			in your household and have him join you in your next endeavour. At the start of an Adventuring phase you may pick one 
			servant to accompany you: 
			<ul>
				<li>
				Page: a page assists you in all your daily routines, like washing and dressing, and takes care of your clothes and gear. 
				He is at your side during any encounter, making sure that you are properly introduced and providing advice and counsel. 
				When you enjoy the help of a page, you can roll the Feat die twice and keep the best result when you are making any Courtesy and Insight rolls. 
				</li>
				<li>
				Physician: a physician is an older servant who has long been trained in the arts of taking care of your health. He knows every little 
				ailment you might have suffered from since you were a child, and possesses the knowledge to prepare a remedy. As long as you are assisted 
				by a physician, you can roll the Feat die twice and keep the best result when you are making a Healing roll.
				</li>
				<li>
				Porter: a porter helps you in carrying your gear when you are adventuring. When you are making a Fatigue test, you can roll the Feat die 
				twice and keep the best result. 
				</li>
				<li>
				Scrivener: a scrivener is a personal servant who can read and write. He is usually well-learned and keeps a daily record of your exploits, 
				if you are employing a scrivener you can roll the Feat die twice and keep the best result when you are making any Lore and Riddle rolls. 
				</li>
			</ul>
			With the exception of a physician, a servant in a rich trading family is usually a young boy, often a minor relative of modest ambition. 
			Regardless of his duty, your servant is no fighting man, but is considered to be always around and eager to perform his assigned task. 
		</div>
		<div name="shieldFighting" fullname="Shield-fighting">
			You have learnt to wield a shield like the boatmen of Esgaroth do when they fight to repel enemies trying to board their ships. 
			<br/>
			• If you are fighting using a shield of any type, when you successfully hit an enemy roll the Feat die again: on a roll of 8+ you inflict 
			an additional loss of Endurance equal to your Damage rating plus the Encumbrance value of the shield you are using (1 for Buckler, 3 for Shield, 5 for Great Shield).
		</div>
		<div name="tradersSavvy" fullname="Trader's Savvy">
			Some say that "fair speech may hide a foul heart", but you have lived among merchants and traders long enough to know that pleasant words 
			are always received better than harsh ones when dealing with strangers. 
			<br/>
			• When you are about to play out an encounter, you can attempt to raise its Tolerance rating making a roll with any custom skill 
			(Song, Courtesy or Riddle) against TN 14. On a successful roll, add +1 to the Tolerance of the encounter, +2 if the roll was a great success, 
			or +3 if the roll was an extraordinary success. 
		</div>
		<div name="waterLegs" fullname="Water Legs">
			Life on the lake has taught you how to move appropriately when on board a moving boat. Now that you have taken up adventuring you can exploit 
			your superior balance to your advantage even when you are on dry land. 
			<br/>
			• When an opponent is attacking you in combat, before the dice are rolled, you may spend a bonus Success die due to a Combat advantage 
			to get a bonus of +3 to your Parry score. Additionally, if you are fighting on a boat, a raft, or other precarious or risky surface 
			(for example, an Elven tree platform, a rope bridge) you receive one free Combat advantage bonus die during Onset. 
		</div>
		<div name="brazenArmour" fullname="Brazen Armour">
			(mail armour) 
			<br/>
			Men-folk out of the East favour suits of armour made of overlapping brass plates, or composed of small scales arranged in a mesh, like the 
			scales on a fish or the feathers of birds. Many of these elaborate coats have been hanging on the walls of the great hall of Lake-town, 
			waiting for heroes worthy to wear them. 
			<br/>
			• A Brazen armour is the equivalent of a suit of mail armour, but wearing it allows you to roll one additional Success die on a Protection 
			roll against an attack made with a edged or blunt melee weapon (swords, axes and clubs), and one Success die less against spears and arrows,
			or other types of penetrating attacks.
		</div>
		<div name="keeningBogStone" fullname="Keening Bog-Stone">
			Among the most unusual and rare possessions of a lake-men household are these unassuming whetstones, small flat pebbles never bigger than 
			a pigeon egg, black in colour and faintly traced with green veins. They can be obtained from the oldest and most superstitious fishermen 
			of the town, who swear they get them in exchange for iron tool offerings left in certain areas of the Long Marshes. 
			<br/>
			• If you carry a Keening Bog-stone in a pouch or wear it as a necklace, it vibrates and emits a soft wailing sound when a creature possessing 
			the Hate Sunlight or Denizen of the Dark special abilities is close (within 100 yards). Additionally, the first attack you aim at such a

			(sword)
			<br/>
			Exotic blades from the distant South are the most sought-after collector's items among the more fashionable merchants of Lake-town. 
			Most of those that find their way to the North are useless ceremonial blades of cheaply damasked iron, with lacquered hilts and scabbards 
			set with coloured stones. A rare few are the work of truly superior craftsmanship, quick and deadly weapons in the hand of a skilled fighter. 
			<br/>
			• When making a melee attack using a Serpent scimitar, ignore any Parry rating bonus your target has that is due to them carrying a shield.

		<div name="woodmanMH" fullname="Woodman of Mountain Hall">
			The Woodmen of Mountain Hall are cousins and 
			oathbrothers to the Woodmen of Mirkwood, and live in a 
			long steep-sided valley near the head of the river Icewater.
			<br/>
			Their Mountain Hall — Firienseld in the language of the 
			Vales of Anduin — is an easily defended burg in the shadow 
			of the mountains, built atop their mines. It needs every wall 
			and trench, as the Goblins often threaten the Hall. 

		</div>
		<div name="mountainFighters" fullname="Mountain Fighters">
			The Woodmen of Firienseld have learned how to put 
			the unforgiving features of the mountains to their 
			advantage when they are involved in a fight.
			<br/>
			• When the Woodmen fight in the mountains, they 
			use their favoured Wits score as their basic Parry 
			rating.
		</div>
		<div name="hobbitVA" fullname="Wild Hobbit of the Valley of Anduin">
			Many people believe wild Hobbits to be nothing more 
			than children’s stories, but the truth is that a few 
			halflings still live in the region about the Gladden 
			Fields. They don’t live in comfortable Hobbit-holes, 
			but hide under the eaves of Mirkwood or dig a refuge 
			along the river-bank for a night and move on. They 
			have little contact with the humans of the region; 
			the dangers of Wilderland have turned them into 
			a secretive, shy folk, quite unlike their sedentary, 
			settled cousins of Eriador. They play little part in 
			the affairs of the region, and consider most humans 
			to be as dangerous and oversized as Orcs. Only a few 
			trustworthy people, mostly River-folk, know where 
			these halflings make their home.
		</div>
		<div name="shadowSight" fullname="Shadow-Sight">
			The wild Hobbits of the Vales of Anduin who survived 
			the coming of the Shadow over Mirkwood have been 
			made tougher by the experience, and are more aware 
			of its threats. They have learned to recognise the 
			presence of its minions and the traces of his devilry.
			<br/>
			• When a wild Hobbit makes a HUNTING or 
			AWARENESS roll to track or perceive the 
			proximity of an evil creature or a servant of the 
			Shadow, he adds his Attribute score to the result, 
			as if enjoying an Attribute bonus. Additionally, 
			when making a Corruption test to resist the taint 
			of a blighted place, wild Hobbits can roll the Feat 
			die twice and keep the best result.
		</div>
		<div name="theCallOfMirkwood" fullname="The Call of Mirkwood">
			You think your fate and that of your race should be that of enjoying life to the fullest, as long as Mirkwood and 
			the world endure. You accept the price of this choice: you will dwindle and fade until you become a living memory, a 
			fairy who lingers yet in the shadows of the trees. For the moment though, your fading just makes it harder for others 
			to heed your footsteps, or to see you when you choose not to be seen.
			<br/>
			• You may spend a point of Hope to automatically succeed at any STEALTH roll. Additionally, when you make a 
			roll using a Movement or a Survival skill, you ignore the effects of being Weary.
			<br/>
			• Unfortunately, your fading does not pass unnoticed; other Elves recognise your refusal to depart into the West 
			with a simple look, and treat you as a wild and wilful creature, not deserving trust: your Valour and Wisdom are 
			considered to be equal to 1 for the purposes of determining the Tolerance of an encounter. 
		</div>
		<div name="riverBlooded" fullname="River-Blooded">
			A secret about your heritage has been revealed to you — according to family tradition, one of your ancestors was a 
			lover of one of the River-Maidens, and she left him with a child to raise. You are descended from that child.
			<br/>
			• You automatically succeed at any ATHLETiCS roll related to boating or swimming, and all your Attribute 
			bonuses are based on your Favoured rating when on or near the Dusky River. Furthermore, you may understand the 
			speech of the black herons that live along the riverbanks.

			</li>
			<li>
				The Online Server window has seen its layout changed. Thanks Garn for the suggestion.
			</li>
			<li>
				Added a new button to the main menu to hide all volatile cells for printing. The volatile cells are those whose values are prone to change often during a game or after character development and you would like them being blank for printing. Thanks Thriddle for the suggestion!

			</li>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Added Carried checkboxes to all weapon gear and armor gear rows. When marked, that gear is considered to be carried by the character, and its Encumbrance value 
				will be added to the Fatigue. When not marked, it is owned by the character but left at home or carried by a mule.<br/>
				When you load your character for first time after this change, you will have all gear off. Just mark the ones you want to carry back on.
			</li>
			<li>
				You can now remove a weapon skill without removing the whole row.
			</li>
			<li>
				Cosmetic change: Next button will appear always to the right. (Thanks, Chryckan)<br/>				
				Cosmetic change: Fixed black page printing in Chrome. <br/>
				Cosmetic change: Changed all fonts to printable ones. Because of an unfixed bug in Firefox itself, you can't get the webfonts printed in that browser. They have to fix that.				
			</li>
			<li>
				Fixed page not rememebering Font selection or What's New read status.
			</li>
			<li>
				Fixed backspace not working on text fields, or Enter not working on the Culture Selection window.
			</li>
		</ul>
		February 21st, 2012<br/>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Fixed the problem with mobile browsers not showing the page. Sorry!
			</li>
			<li>
				Print button removed. Use your browser's print command to print instead. Fixed the back background on the print preview in Chrome. (Still some glitches)
			</li>
			<li>
				You can now change the fonts in the page to the previous ones by clicking the Change Font button. It will remember your selection.
			</li>
			<li>
				You can now change how the popup descriptions of game items work. <br/>
				By default, when hovering the mouse over a game items, a little (?) button will appear next to it. 
				Click on that button to get a window with the description of the item.<br/>
				Alternatively you can click the Popup Help Buttons button to change back to the classic popup tooltips.<br/>
				You can click the Popup Tooltips button again to remove any kind of popup help.<br/>
				You can click again to go back to popup buttons. The page will remember your selection.
			</li>
			<li>
				The Character Creation wizard has now bigger buttons to help using it in smaller screen mobile devices. <br/>
				Also, it has now a Cancel Creation button that will close the wizard and restore the character sheet you had before, regardless of in which stage of the creation you cancelled.<br/>

			</li>

			</li>
			<li>
				The Dice Roller will show in the chat if the roll was made adding (or substracting) any modifier.
			</li>
			<li>
				Several cosmetic tweaks.
			</li>
			<li>
				Experimental new online feature: Synchronization.<br/>
				When you load an online character, you can enable the new Synchronize Changes button.<br/>
				While the button is enabled, all changes made to the character will be sent to the server. <br/>
				The program will check for changes from the server and bring them to update the sheet.<br/>
				This feature should be useful during online games where the same sheet is open by the Loremaster and the players. 
				If both load the character from the server and both enable Synchronization, they will see eachother's changes appear automatically.<br/>
				Please understand that this feature is experimental and you may encounter some glitches. Please, report any bugs. Thanks! :)
